invention.\n* the illustrated embodiment is an endoscopic instrument and, in general, the embodiments of the instrument 10 described herein are endoscopic surgical cutting and fastening instruments. It should be noted, however, that according to other embodiments of the present invention, the instrument may be a non-endoscopic surgical cutting and fastening instrument, such as a laparoscopic instrument.\n* the surgical instrument 10 depicted in FIGS. 1 and 2 comprises a handle 6 , a shaft 8 , and an articulating end effector 12 pivotally connected to the shaft 8 at an articulation pivot 14 .\n* An articulation control 16 may be provided adjacent to the handle 6 to effect rotation of the end effector 12 about the articulation pivot 14 .\n* the end effector 12 is configured to act as an endocutter for clamping, severing and stapling tissue, although, in other embodiments, different types of end effectors may be used, such as end effectors for other types of surgical devices, such as graspers, cutters, staplers, clip appliers, access devices, drug/gene therapy devices, ultrasound, RF or laser devices, etc.\n* the handle 6 of the instrument 10 may include a closure trigger 18 and a firing trigger 20 for actuating the end effector 12 .\n* the end effector 12 is shown separated from the handle 6 by a preferably elongate shaft 8 .\n* a clinician or operator of the instrument 10 may articulate the end effector 12 relative to the shaft 8 by utilizing the articulation control 16 , as described in more detail in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/329,020, filed Jan. 10, 2006, entitled SURGICAL INSTRUMENT HAVING AN ARTICULATING END EFFECTOR, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,670,334, which is incorporated herein by reference.\n* the end effector 12 includes in this example, among other things, a staple channel 22 and a pivotally translatable clamping member, such as an anvil 24 , which are maintained at a spacing that assures effective stapling and severing of tissue clamped in the end effector 12 .\n* the handle 6 includes a pistol grip 26 towards which a closure trigger 18 is pivotally drawn by the clinician to cause clamping or closing of the anvil 24 toward the staple channel 22 of the end effector 12 to thereby clamp tissue positioned between the anvil 24 and channel 22 .\n* the firing trigger 20 is farther outboard of the closure trigger 18 . Once the closure trigger 18 is locked in the closure position as further described below, the firing trigger 20 may rotate slightly toward the pistol grip 26 so that it can be reached by the operator using one hand.\n* the operator may pivotally draw the firing trigger 20 toward the pistol grip 12 to cause the stapling and severing of clamped tissue in the end effector 12 .\n* different types of clamping members besides the anvil 24 could be used, such as, for example, an opposing jaw, etc.\n* proximal and distal are used herein with reference to a clinician gripping the handle 6 of an instrument 10 .\n* end effector 12 is distal with respect to the more proximal handle 6 .\n* spatial terms such as âverticalâ and âhorizontalâ are used herein with respect to the drawings.\n* surgical instruments are used in many orientations and positions, and these terms are not intended to be limiting and absolute.\n* the closure trigger 18 may be actuated first. Once the clinician is satisfied with the positioning of the end effector 12 , the clinician may draw back the closure trigger 18 to its fully closed, locked position proximate to the pistol grip 26 . The firing trigger 20 may then be actuated. The firing trigger 20 returns to the open position (shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 ) when the clinician removes pressure, as described more fully below. A release button on the handle 6 , when depressed may release the locked closure trigger 18 .\n* the release button may be implemented in various forms such as, for example, as a slide release button 160 shown in FIG. 14 , and/or button 172 shown in FIG. 16 .\n* FIG. 3 is an exploded view of the end effector 12 according to various embodiments.\n* the end effector 12 may include, in addition to the previously-mentioned channel 22 and anvil 24 , a cutting instrument 32 , a sled 33 , a staple cartridge 34 that is removably seated in the channel 22 , and a helical screw shaft 36 .\n* the cutting instrument 32 may be, for example, a knife.\n* the anvil 24 may be pivotably opened and closed at a pivot point 25 connected to the proximate end of the channel 22 .\n* the anvil 24 may also include a tab 27 at its proximate end that is inserted into a component of the mechanical closure system (described further below) to open and close the anvil 24 .\n* the anvil 24 may pivot about the pivot point 25 into the clamped or closed position. If clamping of the end effector 12 is satisfactory, the operator may actuate the firing trigger 20 , which, as explained in more detail below, causes the knife 32 and sled 33 to travel longitudinally along the channel 22 , thereby cutting tissue clamped within the end effector 12 . The movement of the sled 33 along the channel 22 causes the staples of the staple cartridge 34 to be driven through the severed tissue and against the closed anvil 24 , which turns the staples to fasten the severed tissue. In various embodiments, the sled 33 may be an integral component of the cartridge 34 .\n* the sled 33 may be part of the cartridge 34 , such that when the knife 32 retracts following the cutting operation, the sled 33 does not retract.\n* FIGS. 4 and 5 are exploded views and FIG. 6 is a side view of the end effector 12 and shaft 8 according to various embodiments.\n* the shaft 8 may include a proximate closure tube 40 and a distal closure tube 42 pivotably linked by a pivot links 44 .\n* the distal closure tube 42 includes an opening 45 into which the tab 27 on the anvil 24 is inserted in order to open and close the anvil 24 , as further described below.\n* Disposed inside the closure tubes 40 , 42 may be a proximate spine tube 46 .\n* Disposed inside the proximate spine tube 46 may be a main rotational (or proximate) drive shaft 48 that communicates with a secondary (or distal) drive shaft 50 via a bevel gear assembly 52 .\n* the secondary drive shaft 50 is connected to a drive gear 54 that engages a proximate drive gear 56 of the helical screw shaft 36 .\n* the vertical bevel gear 52 b may sit and pivot in an opening 57 in the distal end of the proximate spine tube 46 .\n* a distal spine tube 58 may be used to enclose the secondary drive shaft 50 and the drive gears 54 , 56 .\n* a bearing 38 positioned at a distal end of the staple channel 22 , receives the helical drive screw 36 , allowing the helical drive screw 36 to freely rotate with respect to the channel 22 .\n* the helical screw shaft 36 may interface a threaded opening (not shown) of the knife 32 such that rotation of the shaft 36 causes the knife 32 to translate distally or proximately (depending on the direction of the rotation) through the staple channel 22 .\n* the bevel gear assembly 52 a - c causes the secondary drive shaft 50 to rotate, which in turn, because of the engagement of the drive gears 54 , 56 , causes the helical screw shaft 36 to rotate, which causes the knife driving member 32 to travel longitudinally along the channel 22 to cut any tissue clamped within the end effector.\n* the sled 33 may be made of, for example, plastic, and may have a sloped distal surface. As the sled 33 traverse the channel 22 , the sloped forward surface may push up or drive the staples in the staple cartridge through the clamped tissue and against the anvil 24 . The anvil 24 turns the staples, thereby stapling the severed tissue. When the knife 32 is retracted, the knife 32 and sled 33 may become disengaged, thereby leaving the sled 33 at the distal end of the channel 22 .\n* embodiments of the present invention provide a motor-driven endocutter with user-feedback of the deployment, force, and/or position of the cutting instrument in the end effector.\n* FIGS. 7 - 10 illustrate an exemplary embodiment of a motor-driven endocutter, and in particular the handle thereof, that provides user-feedback regarding the deployment and loading force of the cutting instrument in the end effector.\n* the embodiment may use power provided by the user in retracting the firing trigger 20 to power the device (a so-called âpower assistâ mode).\n* the handle 6 includes exterior lower side pieces 59 , 60 and exterior upper side pieces 61 , 62 that fit together to form, in general, the exterior of the handle 6 .\n* a battery 64 such as a Li ion battery, may be provided in the pistol grip portion 26 of the handle 6 .\n* the battery 64 powers a motor 65 disposed in an upper portion of the pistol grip portion 26 of the handle 6 .\n* the motor 65 may be a DC brushed driving motor having a maximum rotation of, approximately, 5000 RPM.\n* the motor 64 may drive a 90Â° bevel gear assembly 66 comprising a first bevel gear 68 and a second bevel gear 70 .\n* the bevel gear assembly 66 may drive a planetary gear assembly 72 .\n* the planetary gear assembly 72 may include a pinion gear 74 connected to a drive shaft 76 .\n* the pinion gear 74 may drive a mating ring gear 78 that drives a helical gear drum 80 via a drive shaft 82 .\n* a ring 84 may be threaded on the helical gear drum 80 .\n* the handle 6 may also include a run motor sensor 110 in communication with the firing trigger 20 to detect when the firing trigger 20 has been drawn in (or âclosedâ) toward the pistol grip portion 26 of the handle 6 by the operator to thereby actuate the cutting/stapling operation by the end effector 12 .\n* the sensor 110 may be a proportional sensor such as, for example, a rheostat or variable resistor. When the firing trigger 20 is drawn in, the sensor 110 detects the movement, and sends an electrical signal indicative of the voltage (or power) to be supplied to the motor 65 . When the sensor 110 is a variable resistor or the like, the rotation of the motor 65 may be generally proportional to the amount of movement of the firing trigger 20 .\n* the rotation of the motor 65 is relatively low.\n* the rotation of the motor 65 is at its maximum. In other words, the harder the user pulls on the firing trigger 20 , the more voltage is applied to the motor 65 , causing greater rates of rotation.\n* the handle 6 may include a middle handle piece 104 adjacent to the upper portion of the firing trigger 20 .\n* the handle 6 also may comprise a bias spring 112 connected between posts on the middle handle piece 104 and the firing trigger 20 .\n* the bias spring 112 may bias the firing trigger 20 to its fully open position. In that way, when the operator releases the firing trigger 20 , the bias spring 112 will pull the firing trigger 20 to its open position, thereby removing actuation of the sensor 110 , thereby stopping rotation of the motor 65 .\n* the bias spring 112 any time a user closes the firing trigger 20 , the user will experience resistance to the closing operation, thereby providing the user with feedback as to the amount of rotation exerted by the motor 65 .\n* the operator could stop retracting the firing trigger 20 to thereby remove force from the sensor 100 , to thereby stop the motor 65 .\n* the user may stop the deployment of the end effector 12 , thereby providing a measure of control of the cutting/fastening operation to the operator.\n* the distal end of the helical gear drum 80 includes a distal drive shaft 120 that drives a ring gear 122 , which mates with a pinion gear 124 .\n* the pinion gear 124 is connected to the main drive shaft 48 of the main drive shaft assembly. In that way, rotation of the motor 65 causes the main drive shaft assembly to rotate, which causes actuation of the end effector 12 , as described above.\n* the ring 84 threaded on the helical gear drum 80 may include a post 86 that is disposed within a slot 88 of a slotted arm 90 .\n* the slotted arm 90 has an opening 92 its opposite end 94 that receives a pivot pin 96 that is connected between the handle exterior side pieces 59 , 60 .\n* the pivot pin 96 is also disposed through an opening 100 in the firing trigger 20 and an opening 102 in the middle handle piece 104 .\n* the handle 6 may include a reverse motor (or end-of-stroke sensor) 130 and a stop motor (or beginning-of-stroke) sensor 142 .\n* the reverse motor sensor 130 may be a limit switch located at the distal end of the helical gear drum 80 such that the ring 84 threaded on the helical gear drum 80 contacts and trips the reverse motor sensor 130 when the ring 84 reaches the distal end of the helical gear drum 80 .\n* the reverse motor sensor 130 when activated, sends a signal to the motor 65 to reverse its rotation direction, thereby withdrawing the knife 32 of the end effector 12 following the cutting operation.\n* the stop motor sensor 142 may be, for example, a normally-closed limit switch. In various embodiments, it may be located at the proximate end of the helical gear drum 80 so that the ring 84 trips the switch 142 when the ring 84 reaches the proximate end of the helical gear drum 80 .\n* the sensor 110 detects the deployment of the firing trigger 20 and sends a signal to the motor 65 to cause forward rotation of the motor 65 at, for example, a rate proportional to how hard the operator pulls back the firing trigger 20 .\n* the forward rotation of the motor 65 in turn causes the ring gear 78 at the distal end of the planetary gear assembly 72 to rotate, thereby causing the helical gear drum 80 to rotate, causing the ring 84 threaded on the helical gear drum 80 to travel distally along the helical gear drum 80 .\n* the rotation of the helical gear drum 80 also drives the main drive shaft assembly as described above, which in turn causes deployment of the knife 32 in the end effector 12 .\n* the knife 32 and sled 33 are caused to traverse the channel 22 longitudinally, thereby cutting tissue clamped in the end effector 12 .\n* the stapling operation of the end effector 12 is caused to happen in embodiments where a stapling-type end effector is used.\n* the ring 84 on the helical gear drum 80 will have reached the distal end of the helical gear drum 80 , thereby causing the reverse motor sensor 130 to be tripped, which sends a signal to the motor 65 to cause the motor 65 to reverse its rotation. This in turn causes the knife 32 to retract, and also causes the ring 84 on the helical gear drum 80 to move back to the proximate end of the helical gear drum 80 .\n* the middle handle piece 104 includes a backside shoulder 106 that engages the slotted arm 90 as best shown in FIGS. 8 and 9 .\n* the middle handle piece 104 also has a forward motion stop 107 that engages the firing trigger 20 .\n* the movement of the slotted arm 90 is controlled, as explained above, by rotation of the motor 65 .\n* the middle handle piece 104 will be free to rotate CCW.\n* the firing trigger 20 will engage the forward motion stop 107 of the middle handle piece 104 , causing the middle handle piece 104 to rotate CCW.\n* the middle handle piece 104 will only be able to rotate CCW as far as the slotted arm 90 permits. In that way, if the motor 65 should stop rotating for some reason, the slotted arm 90 will stop rotating, and the user will not be able to further draw in the firing trigger 20 because the middle handle piece 104 will not be free to rotate CCW due to the slotted arm 90 .\n* FIGS. 41 and 42 illustrate two states of a variable sensor that may be used as the run motor sensor 110 according to various embodiments of the present invention.\n* the sensor 110 may include a face portion 280 , a first electrode (A) 282 , a second electrode (B) 284 , and a compressible dielectric material 286 (e.g., EAP) between the electrodes 282 , 284 .\n* the sensor 110 may be positioned such that the face portion 280 contacts the firing trigger 20 when retracted. Accordingly, when the firing trigger 20 is retracted, the dielectric material 286 is compressed, as shown in FIG. 42 , such that the electrodes 282 , 284 are closer together.\n* the distance âbâ between the electrodes 282 , 284 is directly related to the impedance between the electrodes 282 , 284 , the greater the distance the more impedance, and the closer the distance the less impedance. In that way, the amount that the dielectric 286 is compressed due to retraction of the firing trigger 20 (denoted as force âFâ in FIG. 42 ) is proportional to the impedance between the electrodes 282 , 284 , which can be used to proportionally control the motor 65 .\n* FIGS. 7 - 10 Components of an exemplary closure system for closing (or clamping) the anvil 24 of the end effector 12 by retracting the closure trigger 18 are also shown in FIGS. 7 - 10 .\n* the closure system includes a yoke 250 connected to the closure trigger 18 by a pin 251 that is inserted through aligned openings in both the closure trigger 18 and the yoke 250 .\n* a pivot pin 252 about which the closure trigger 18 pivots, is inserted through another opening in the closure trigger 18 which is offset from where the pin 251 is inserted through the closure trigger 18 .\n* retraction of the closure trigger 18 causes the upper part of the closure trigger 18 , to which the yoke 250 is attached via the pin 251 , to rotate CCW.\n* the distal end of the yoke 250 is connected, via a pin 254 , to a first closure bracket 256 .\n* the first closure bracket 256 connects to a second closure bracket 258 .\n* the closure brackets 256 , 258 define an opening in which the proximate end of the proximate closure tube 40 (see FIG. 4 ) is seated and held such that longitudinal movement of the closure brackets 256 , 258 causes longitudinal motion by the proximate closure tube 40 .\n* the instrument 10 also includes a closure rod 260 disposed inside the proximate closure tube 40 .\n* the closure rod 260 may include a window 261 into which a post 263 on one of the handle exterior pieces, such as exterior lower side piece 59 in the illustrated embodiment, is disposed to fixedly connect the closure rod 260 to the handle 6 . In that way, the proximate closure tube 40 is capable of moving longitudinally relative to the closure rod 260 .\n* the closure rod 260 may also include a distal collar 267 that fits into a cavity 269 in proximate spine tube 46 and is retained therein by a cap 271 (see FIG. 4 ).\n* the closure brackets 256 , 258 cause the proximate closure tube 40 to move distally (i.e., away from the handle end of the instrument 10 ), which causes the distal closure tube 42 to move distally, which causes the anvil 24 to rotate about the pivot point 25 into the clamped or closed position.\n* the proximate closure tube 40 is caused to slide proximately, which causes the distal closure tube 42 to slide proximately, which, by virtue of the tab 27 being inserted in the window 45 of the distal closure tube 42 , causes the anvil 24 to pivot about the pivot point 25 into the open or unclamped position.\n* an operator may clamp tissue between the anvil 24 and channel 22 , and may unclamp the tissue following the cutting/stapling operation by unlocking the closure trigger 20 from the locked position.\n* FIG. 11 is a schematic diagram of an electrical circuit of the instrument 10 according to various embodiments of the present invention.\n* the sensor 110 When an operator initially pulls in the firing trigger 20 after locking the closure trigger 18 , the sensor 110 is activated, allowing current to flow there through. If the normally-open reverse motor sensor switch 130 is open (meaning the end of the end effector stroke has not been reached), current will flow to a single pole, double throw relay 132 . Since the reverse motor sensor switch 130 is not closed, the inductor 134 of the relay 132 will not be energized, so the relay 132 will be in its non-energized state.\n* the circuit also includes a cartridge lockout sensor 136 . If the end effector 12 includes a staple cartridge 34 , the sensor 136 will be in the closed state, allowing current to flow. Otherwise, if the end effector 12 does not include a staple cartridge 34 , the sensor 136 will be open, thereby preventing the battery 64 from powering the motor 65 .\n* the sensor 136 When the staple cartridge 34 is present, the sensor 136 is closed, which energizes a single pole, single throw relay 138 . When the relay 138 is energized, current flows through the relay 136 , through the variable resistor sensor 110 , and to the motor 65 via a double pole, double throw relay 140 , thereby powering the motor 65 and allowing it to rotate in the forward direction.\n* the reverse motor sensor 130 When the end effector 12 reaches the end of its stroke, the reverse motor sensor 130 will be activated, thereby closing the switch 130 and energizing the relay 134 . This causes the relay 134 to assume its energized state (not shown in FIG. 13 ), which causes current to bypass the cartridge lockout sensor 136 and variable resistor 110 , and instead causes current to flow to both the normally-closed double pole, double throw relay 142 and back to the motor 65 , but in a manner, via the relay 140 , that causes the motor 65 to reverse its rotational direction.\n* stop motor sensor switch 142 Because the stop motor sensor switch 142 is normally-closed, current will flow back to the relay 134 to keep it closed until the switch 142 opens. When the knife 32 is fully retracted, the stop motor sensor switch 142 is activated, causing the switch 142 to open, thereby removing power from the motor 65 .\n* an on-off type sensor could be used.\n* the rate of rotation of the motor 65 would not be proportional to the force applied by the operator. Rather, the motor 65 would generally rotate at a constant rate. But the operator would still experience force feedback because the firing trigger 20 is geared into the gear drive train.\n* FIG. 12 is a side-view of the handle 6 of a power-assist motorized endocutter according to another embodiment.\n* the embodiment of FIG. 12 is similar to that of FIGS. 7 - 10 except that in the embodiment of FIG. 12 , there is not slotted arm connected to the ring 84 threaded on the helical gear drum 80 .\n* the ring 84 includes a sensor portion 114 that moves with the ring 84 as the ring 84 advances down (and back) on the helical gear drum 80 .\n* the sensor portion 114 includes a notch 116 .\n* the reverse motor sensor 130 may be located at the distal end of the notch 116 and the stop motor sensor 142 may be located at the proximate end of the notch 116 .\n* the middle piece 104 may have an arm 118 that extends into the notch 12 .\n* the run motor sensor 110 detects the motion and sends a signal to power the motor 65 , which causes, among other things, the helical gear drum 80 to rotate.\n* the ring 84 threaded on the helical gear drum 80 advances (or retracts, depending on the rotation).\n* the middle piece 104 is caused to rotate CCW with the firing trigger 20 due to the forward motion stop 107 that engages the firing trigger 20 .\n* the CCW rotation of the middle piece 104 cause the arm 118 to rotate CCW with the sensor portion 114 of the ring 84 such that the arm 118 stays disposed in the notch 116 .\n* the arm 118 will contact and thereby trip the reverse motor sensor 130 .\n* the arm will contact and thereby trip the stop motor sensor 142 .\n* Such actions may reverse and stop the motor 65 , respectively, as described above.\n* FIG. 13 is a side-view of the handle 6 of a power-assist motorized endocutter according to another embodiment.\n* the embodiment of FIG. 13 is similar to that of FIGS. 7 - 10 except that in the embodiment of FIG. 13 , there is no slot in the arm 90 .\n* the ring 84 threaded on the helical gear drum 80 includes a vertical channel 126 .\n* the arm 90 includes a post 128 that is disposed in the channel 126 .\n* the ring 84 threaded on the helical gear drum advances (or retracts, depending on the rotation).\n* the arm 90 rotates CCW as the ring 84 advances due to the post 128 being disposed in the channel 126 , as shown in FIG. 13 .\n* FIGS. 14 and 15 show one embodiment of a way to lock the closure trigger 18 to the pistol grip portion 26 of the handle 6 .\n* the pistol grip portion 26 includes a hook 150 that is biased to rotate CCW about a pivot point 151 by a torsion spring 152 .\n* the closure trigger 18 includes a closure bar 154 . As the operator draws in the closure trigger 18 , the closure bar 154 engages a sloped portion 156 of the hook 150 , thereby rotating the hook 150 upward (or CW in FIGS.\n* closure trigger 18 may release the closure trigger 18 by pushing down on a slide button release 160 on the back or opposite side of the pistol grip portion 26 . Pushing down the slide button release 160 rotates the hook 150 CW such that the closure bar 154 is released from the recessed notch 158 .\n* FIG. 16 shows another closure trigger locking mechanism according to various embodiments.\n* the closure trigger 18 includes a wedge 160 having an arrow-head portion 161 .\n* the arrow-head portion 161 is biased downward (or CW) by a leaf spring 162 .\n* the wedge 160 and leaf spring 162 may be made from, for example, molded plastic.\n* the arrow-head portion 161 is inserted through an opening 164 in the pistol grip portion 26 of the handle 6 .\n* a lower chamfered surface 166 of the arrow-head portion 161 engages a lower sidewall 168 of the opening 164 , forcing the arrow-head portion 161 to rotate CCW.\n* a user presses down on a button 172 on the opposite side of the closure trigger 18 , causing the arrow-head portion 161 to rotate CCW and allowing the arrow-head portion 161 to slide out of the opening 164 .\n* FIGS. 17 - 22 show a closure trigger locking mechanism according to another embodiment.\n* the closure trigger 18 includes a flexible longitudinal arm 176 that includes a lateral pin 178 extending therefrom.\n* the arm 176 and pin 178 may be made from molded plastic, for example.\n* the pistol grip portion 26 of the handle 6 includes an opening 180 with a laterally extending wedge 182 disposed therein.\n* the pin 178 engages the wedge 182 , and the pin 178 is forced downward (i.e., the arm 176 is rotated CW) by the lower surface 184 of the wedge 182 , as shown in FIGS. 17 and 18 .\n* the operator may further squeeze the closure trigger 18 , causing the pin 178 to engage a sloped backwall 190 of the opening 180 , forcing the pin 178 upward past the flexible stop 188 , as shown in FIGS. 20 and 21 .\n* the pin 178 is then free to travel out an upper channel 192 in the opening 180 such that the closure trigger 18 is no longer locked to the pistol grip portion 26 , as shown in FIG. 22 .\n* FIGS. 23 A-B show a universal joint (âu-jointâ) 195 .\n* the second piece 195 - 2 of the u-joint 195 rotates in a horizontal plane in which the first piece 195 - 1 lies.\n* FIG. 23 A shows the u-joint 195 in a linear (180Â°) orientation and\n* FIG. 23 B shows the u-joint 195 at approximately a 150Â° orientation.\n* the u-joint 195 may be used instead of the bevel gears 52 a - c (see FIG. 4 , for example) at the articulation point 14 of the main drive shaft assembly to articulate the end effector 12 .\n* FIGS. 24 A-B show a torsion cable 197 that may be used in lieu of both the bevel gears 52 a - c and the u-joint 195 to realize articulation of the end effector 12 .\n* FIGS. 25 - 31 illustrate another embodiment of a motorized, two-stroke surgical cutting and fastening instrument 10 with power assist according to another embodiment of the present invention.\n* the embodiment of FIGS. 25 - 31 is similar to that of FIGS. 6 - 10 except that instead of the helical gear drum 80 , the embodiment of FIGS. 23 - 28 includes an alternative gear drive assembly.\n* the embodiment of FIGS. 25 - 31 includes a gear box assembly 200 including a number of gears disposed in a frame 201 , wherein the gears are connected between the planetary gear 72 and the pinion gear 124 at the proximate end of the drive shaft 48 .\n* the gear box assembly 200 provides feedback to the user via the firing trigger 20 regarding the deployment and loading force of the end effector 12 .\n* the user may provide power to the system via the gear box assembly 200 to assist the deployment of the end effector 12 .\n* the embodiment of FIGS. 23 - 32 is another power assist, motorized instrument 10 that provides feedback to the user regarding the loading force experienced by the cutting instrument.\n* the firing trigger 20 includes two pieces: a main body portion 202 and a stiffening portion 204 .\n* the main body portion 202 may be made of plastic, for example, and the stiffening portion 204 may be made out of a more rigid material, such as metal.\n* the stiffening portion 204 is adjacent to the main body portion 202 , but according to other embodiments, the stiffening portion 204 could be disposed inside the main body portion 202 .\n* a pivot pin 209 may be inserted through openings in the firing trigger pieces 202 , 204 and may be the point about which the firing trigger 20 rotates.\n* a spring 222 may bias the firing trigger 20 to rotate in a CCW direction.\n* the spring 222 may have a distal end connected to a pin 224 that is connected to the pieces 202 , 204 of the firing trigger 20 .\n* the proximate end of the spring 222 may be connected to one of the handle exterior lower side pieces 59 , 60 .\n* both the main body portion 202 and the stiffening portion 204 includes gear portions 206 , 208 (respectively) at their upper end portions.\n* the gear portions 206 , 208 engage a gear in the gear box assembly 200 , as explained below, to drive the main drive shaft assembly and to provide feedback to the user regarding the deployment of the end effector 12 .\n* the gear box assembly 200 may include as shown, in the illustrated embodiment, six (6) gears.\n* a first gear 210 of the gear box assembly 200 engages the gear portions 206 , 208 of the firing trigger 20 .\n* the first gear 210 engages a smaller second gear 212 , the smaller second gear 212 being coaxial with a large third gear 214 .\n* the third gear 214 engages a smaller fourth gear 216 , the smaller fourth gear being coaxial with a fifth gear 218 .\n* the fifth gear 218 is a 90Â° bevel gear that engages a mating 90Â° bevel gear 220 (best shown in FIG. 31 ) that is connected to the pinion gear 124 that drives the main drive shaft 48 .\n* a run motor sensor (not shown) is activated, which may provide a signal to the motor 65 to rotate at a rate proportional to the extent or force with which the operator is retracting the firing trigger 20 .\n* the sensor is not shown for this embodiment, but it could be similar to the run motor sensor 110 described above.\n* the sensor could be located in the handle 6 such that it is depressed when the firing trigger 20 is retracted. Also, instead of a proportional-type sensor, an on/off type sensor may be used.\n* Rotation of the motor 65 causes the bevel gears 66 , 70 to rotate, which causes the planetary gear 72 to rotate, which causes, via the drive shaft 76 , the ring gear 122 to rotate.\n* the ring gear 122 meshes with the pinion gear 124 , which is connected to the main drive shaft 48 .\n* rotation of the pinion gear 124 drives the main drive shaft 48 , which causes actuation of the cutting/stapling operation of the end effector 12 .\n* Forward rotation of the pinion gear 124 in turn causes the bevel gear 220 to rotate, which causes, by way of the rest of the gears of the gear box assembly 200 , the first gear 210 to rotate.\n* the first gear 210 engages the gear portions 206 , 208 of the firing trigger 20 , thereby causing the firing trigger 20 to rotate CCW when the motor 65 provides forward drive for the end effector 12 (and to rotate CCW when the motor 65 rotates in reverse to retract the end effector 12 ).\n* the user experiences feedback regarding loading force and deployment of the end effector 12 by way of the user's grip on the firing trigger 20 .\n* the operator will experience a resistance related to the load force experienced by the end effector 12 .\n* the operator releases the firing trigger 20 after the cutting/stapling operation so that it can return to its original position, the user will experience a CW rotation force from the firing trigger 20 that is generally proportional to the reverse speed of the motor 65 .\n* the user can apply force (either in lieu of or in addition to the force from the motor 65 ) to actuate the main drive shaft assembly (and hence the cutting/stapling operation of the end effector 12 ) through retracting the firing trigger 20 . That is, retracting the firing trigger 20 causes the gear portions 206 , 208 to rotate CCW, which causes the gears of the gear box assembly 200 to rotate, thereby causing the pinion gear 124 to rotate, which causes the main drive shaft 48 to rotate.\n* the instrument 10 may further include reverse motor and stop motor sensors.\n* the reverse motor and stop motor sensors may detect, respectively, the end of the cutting stroke (full deployment of the knife/sled driving member 32 ) and the end of retraction operation (full retraction of the knife/sled driving member 32 ).\n* a similar circuit to that described above in connection with FIG. 11 may be used to appropriately power the motor 65 .\n* FIGS. 32 - 36 illustrate a two-stroke, motorized surgical cutting and fastening instrument 10 with power assist according to another embodiment.\n* the embodiment of FIGS. 32 - 36 is similar to that of FIGS. 25 - 31 except that in the embodiment of FIGS. 32 - 36 , the firing trigger 20 includes a lower portion 228 and an upper portion 230 . Both portions 228 , 230 are connected to and pivot about a pivot pin 207 that is disposed through each portion 228 , 230 .\n* the upper portion 230 includes a gear portion 232 that engages the first gear 210 of the gear box assembly 200 .\n* the spring 222 is connected to the upper portion 230 such that the upper portion is biased to rotate in the CW direction.\n* the upper portion 230 may also include a lower arm 234 that contacts an upper surface of the lower portion 228 of the firing trigger 20 such that when the upper portion 230 is caused to rotate CW the lower portion 228 also rotates CW, and when the lower portion 228 rotates CCW the upper portion 230 also rotates CCW.\n* the lower portion 228 includes a rotational stop 238 that engages a lower shoulder of the upper portion 230 . In that way, when the upper portion 230 is caused to rotate CCW the lower portion 228 also rotates CCW, and when the lower portion 228 rotates CW the upper portion 230 also rotates CW.\n* the illustrated embodiment also includes the run motor sensor 110 that communicates a signal to the motor 65 that, in various embodiments, may cause the motor 65 to rotate at a speed proportional to the force applied by the operator when retracting the firing trigger 20 .\n* the sensor 110 may be, for example, a rheostat or some other variable resistance sensor, as explained herein.\n* the instrument 10 may include a reverse motor sensor 130 that is tripped or switched when contacted by a front face 242 of the upper portion 230 of the firing trigger 20 . When activated, the reverse motor sensor 130 sends a signal to the motor 65 to reverse direction.\n* the instrument 10 may include a stop motor sensor 142 that is tripped or actuated when contacted by the lower portion 228 of the firing trigger 20 . When activated, the stop motor sensor 142 sends a signal to stop the reverse rotation of the motor 65 .\n* the firing trigger 20 In operation, when an operator retracts the closure trigger 18 into the locked position, the firing trigger 20 is retracted slightly (through mechanisms known in the art, including U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,978,921 and 6,905,057, which are incorporated herein by reference) so that the user can grasp the firing trigger 20 to initiate the cutting/stapling operation, as shown in FIGS. 32 and 33 . At that point, as shown in FIG. 33 , the gear portion 232 of the upper portion 230 of the firing trigger 20 moves into engagement with the first gear 210 of the gear box assembly 200 . When the operator retracts the firing trigger 20 , according to various embodiments, the firing trigger 20 may rotate a small amount, such as five degrees, before tripping the run motor sensor 110 , as shown in FIG.\n* Activation of the sensor 110 causes the motor 65 to forward rotate at a rate proportional to the retraction force applied by the operator.\n* the forward rotation of the motor 65 causes, as described above, the main drive shaft 48 to rotate, which causes the knife 32 in the end effector 12 to be deployed (i.e., begin traversing the channel 22 ).\n* Rotation of the pinion gear 124 which is connected to the main drive shaft 48 , causes the gears 210 - 220 in the gear box assembly 200 to rotate. Since the first gear 210 is in engagement with the gear portion 232 of the upper portion 230 of the firing trigger 20 , the upper portion 232 is caused to rotate CCW, which causes the lower portion 228 to also rotate CCW.\n* the front face 242 of the upper portion 230 trips the reverse motor sensor 130 , which sends a signal to the motor 65 to reverse rotational directional.\n* Reverse rotation of the main drive shaft assembly causes the gears 210 - 220 in the gear box assembly to reverse direction, which causes the upper portion 230 of the firing trigger 20 to rotate CW, which causes the lower portion 228 of the firing trigger 20 to rotate CW until the lower portion 228 trips or actuates the stop motor sensor 142 when the knife 32 is fully retracted, which causes the motor 65 to stop.\n* the user experiences feedback regarding deployment of the end effector 12 by way of the user's grip on the firing trigger 20 .\n* the operator will experience a resistance related to the deployment of the end effector 12 and, in particular, to the loading force experienced by the knife 32 .\n* the operator releases the firing trigger 20 after the cutting/stapling operation so that it can return to its original position, the user will experience a CW rotation force from the firing trigger 20 that is generally proportional to the reverse speed of the motor 65 .\n* the user can apply force (either in lieu of or in addition to the force from the motor 65 ) to actuate the main drive shaft assembly (and hence the cutting/stapling operation of the end effector 12 ) through retracting the firing trigger 20 . That is, retracting the firing trigger 20 causes the gear portion 232 of the upper portion 230 to rotate CCW, which causes the gears of the gear box assembly 200 to rotate, thereby causing the pinion gear 124 to rotate, which causes the main drive shaft assembly to rotate.\n* FIGS. 37 - 40 illustrate a motorized surgical cutting and fastening instrument with such a tactile position feedback system.\n* the firing trigger 20 may have a lower portion 228 and an upper portion 230 , similar to the instrument 10 shown in FIGS. 32 - 36 .\n* the upper portion 230 does not have a gear portion that mates with part of the gear drive train.\n* the instrument includes a second motor 265 with a threaded rod 266 threaded therein. The threaded rod 266 reciprocates longitudinally in and out of the motor 265 as the motor 265 rotates, depending on the direction of rotation.\n* the instrument 10 also includes an encoder 268 that is responsive to the rotations of the main drive shaft 48 for translating the incremental angular motion of the main drive shaft 48 (or other component of the main drive assembly) into a corresponding series of digital signals, for example.\n* the pinion gear 124 includes a proximate drive shaft 270 that connects to the encoder 268 .\n* the instrument 10 also includes a control circuit (not shown), which may be implemented using a microcontroller or some other type of integrated circuit, that receives the digital signals from the encoder 268 . Based on the signals from the encoder 268 , the control circuit may calculate the stage of deployment of the knife 32 in the end effector 12 . That is, the control circuit can calculate if the knife 32 is fully deployed, fully retracted, or at an intermittent stage. Based on the calculation of the stage of deployment of the end effector 12 , the control circuit may send a signal to the second motor 265 to control its rotation to thereby control the reciprocating movement of the threaded rod 266 .\n* a control circuit (not shown), which may be implemented using a microcontroller or some other type of integrated circuit, that receives the digital signals from the encoder 268 . Based on the signals from the encoder 268 , the control circuit may calculate the stage of deployment of the knife 32 in the end effector 12 . That is, the control circuit can calculate if the knife 32 is fully deployed, fully re\n* the firing trigger 20 rotated away from the pistol grip portion 26 of the handle 6 such that the front face 242 of the upper portion 230 of the firing trigger 20 is not in contact with the proximate end of the threaded rod 266 .\n* the firing trigger 20 rotates slightly towards the closure trigger 20 so that the operator can grasp the firing trigger 20 , as shown in FIG. 38 . In this position, the front face 242 of the upper portion 230 contacts the proximate end of the threaded rod 266 .\n* the run motor sensor 110 may be activated such that, as explained above, the sensor 110 sends a signal to the motor 65 to cause it to rotate at a forward speed proportional to the amount of retraction force applied by the operator to the firing trigger 20 .\n* Forward rotation of the motor 65 causes the main drive shaft 48 to rotate via the gear drive train, which causes the knife 32 and sled 33 to travel down the channel 22 and sever tissue clamped in the end effector 12 .\n* the control circuit receives the output signals from the encoder 268 regarding the incremental rotations of the main drive shaft assembly and sends a signal to the second motor 265 to caused the second motor 265 to rotate, which causes the threaded rod 266 to retract into the motor 265 .\n* This allows the upper portion 230 of the firing trigger 20 to rotate CCW, which allows the lower portion 228 of the firing trigger to also rotate CCW.\n* the operator of the instrument 10 by way of his/her grip on the firing trigger 20 , experiences tactile feedback as to the position of the end effector 12 .\n* the retraction force applied by the operator does not directly affect the drive of the main drive shaft assembly because the firing trigger 20 is not geared into the gear drive train in this embodiment.\n* the control circuit can calculate when the knife 32 is fully deployed (i.e., fully extended). At this point, the control circuit may send a signal to the motor 65 to reverse direction to cause retraction of the knife 32 .\n* the reverse direction of the motor 65 causes the rotation of the main drive shaft assembly to reverse direction, which is also detected by the encoder 268 .\n* the control circuit Based on the reverse rotation detected by the encoder 268 , the control circuit sends a signal to the second motor 265 to cause it to reverse rotational direction such that the threaded rod 266 starts to extend longitudinally from the motor 265 .\n* This motion forces the upper portion 230 of the firing trigger 20 to rotate CW, which causes the lower portion 228 to rotate CW. In that way, the operator may experience a CW force from the firing trigger 20 , which provides feedback to the operator as to the retraction position of the knife 32 in the end effector 12 .\n* the control circuit can determine when the knife 32 is fully retracted.

See FIGS. 56 and 57 .\n* the male splines 2418 are adapted to selectively engage a female spline section 2408 formed on the distal drive shaft portion 2402 as will be discussed in further detail below. See FIGS. 52 - 55 .\n* the clutch assembly 2410 further includes a clutch plate 2420 that is received on the tapered sections 2416 of the tapered clutch member 2412 .

See FIGS. 63 and 64 .\n* a closure nut 2440 is received on the distal drive shaft portion 2402 .\n* the closure nut 2440 has a threaded hole portion 2442 extending partially therethrough to enable it to be threaded onto the closure thread 2406 on the distal drive shaft portion 2402 .\n* the closure nut 2440 has an upstanding closure ramp 2444 protruding therefrom. The top of the closure ramp 2444 terminates in a radiused portion 2446 that extends to an upstanding closure tab 2448 that is adapted to engage a downwardly protruding closure hook 2346 formed on the proximal end 2345 of anvil 2340 .\n* the proximal end 2345 of the anvil 2340 has an anvil closure arm portion 2347 protruding proximally therefrom that terminates in a downwardly extending closure hook 2346 .\n* the bottom surface of the anvil closure arm 2347 has a tab relief groove 2348 therein for receiving the closure tab 2348 when the closure nut 2440 is advanced to its most distal position (shown in FIGS. 69 - 72 ).\n* a closure lock spring 2460 is attached to the bottom of the elongate channel 2302 , by mechanical fastener arrangements or adhesive.\n* the closure lock spring 2460 has an upper portion 2462 that terminates in an upstanding retainer lip 2464 .\n* longitudinally extending retainer arm 2466 is rigidly attached to the upper portion 2462 of the closure lock spring 2460 . See FIG. 46 .\n* anvil 2340 that is capable of moving axially and laterally relative to the elongate channel 2302 prior to being advanced to the closed position. More specifically and with reference to FIGS. 62 - 72 , in various embodiments, the elongate channel 2302 is stamped or otherwise formed from sheet metal or the like and the pivot holes may be punched therein. Such construction leads to reduced manufacturing costs for the end effector. Other embodiments may be machined from rigid materials such as 2416 stainless steel such that the trunnion pins are substantially round in cross-section. Regardless of which manufacturing method is employed to manufacture the anvil 2340 and the resulting shape of the trunnion tabs 2342 , as can be seen in FIGS.\n* the pivot holes 2700 are oval or oblong and serve to afford the trunnion tabs 2342 with the ability to move axially back and forth and up and down in their corresponding pivot hole 2700 .\n* the trunnion tabs 2342 may have a length âXâ of, for example, approximately 0.060 inches and a height âYâ of, for example, approximately 0.050 inches.\n* the pivot holes 2700 have a proximal wall portion 2702 , a distal wall portion 2704 , an upper wall portion 2706 and a lower wall portion 2708 .\n* the distance âLâ between the proximal wall 2702 and the distal wall 2704 may be approximately 0.120 inches and the distance âHâ between the upper wall portion 2706 and lower wall portion 2708 may be approximately 0.090 inches. See FIG. 74 .\n* these distances and tolerances may, in connection with various embodiments, be somewhat dictated by the manufacturing tolerances attainable by the processes used to manufacture the anvil 2340 and the elongate channel 2302 .\n* the distances âHâ, âLâ, âXâ, and âYâ may be sized relative to each other to enable the anvil 2340 to travel along a closing path that is relatively substantially parallel to the top surface of a cartridge 2500 supported in the elongate channel 2302 .\n* Such arrangement serves to prevent or minimize the likelihood of tissue from being rolled out of between the anvil and the cartridge during clamping.\n* these dimensions are merely exemplary and are not intended to be limiting.\n* the trunnion tabs 2342 and the pivot holes 2700 may have other sizes, shapes and dimensions relative to each other that differ from such exemplary dimensions given herein that nevertheless enable those components to operate in the unique and novel manner of various embodiments of the present invention as described herein.\n* FIGS. 62 and 63 illustrate the trunnion tabs 2342 adjacent the proximal end wall portions 2702 of the pivot holes.\n* FIGS. 65 and 44 illustrate the trunnion tabs 2342 after they have crept somewhat midway between the proximal end wall portion 2702 and the distal end wall portion 2704 of the pivot hole 2700 .\n* FIGS. 67 and 68 illustrate the trunnion tabs 2342 after they have crept to a position adjacent the distal end wall portions 2704 of the pivot holes 2700 .\n* the trunnion tabs 2342 are loosely received within their respective pivot holes 2700 and capable of moving axially, laterally and vertically or in combinations of such directions therein.\n* FIGS. 69 - 72 illustrate the anvil 2340 in a closed position.\n* the trunnion tabs 2342 are in abutting contact with a proximal end wall portion 2702 of the pivot hole 2700 .\n* the staple-forming pockets 2350 in the bottom surface 2341 of the anvil 2340 are in axial registration with corresponding staple-receiving pockets 2512 in the cartridge 2500 seated in the elongate channel 2302 such that when the staples 2534 are fired, they are correctly formed by the corresponding pockets 2350 in the anvil 2340 .\n* the anvil 2340 is locked in that position by the retainer lip 2464 portion of the closure lock spring 2460 as will be discussed in further detail below.\n* the anvil 2340 is capable of moving laterally relative to the elongate channel due to manufacturing tolerances in the fabrication of the trunnion tabs 2342 and the pivot holes 2700 .\n* the anvil 2340 is provided with a pair of downwardly extending tissue stops 2344 . During the clamping process, the tissue stops 2344 essentially perform two functions.\n* One of the functions consists of orienting the tissue 2900 within the end effector 2300 so as to prevent the tissue 2900 from extending axially into the end effector 2300 such that it extends beyond the innermost staple pockets 2512 in the cartridge 2500 when seated in the elongate channel 2302 . See FIG. 65 . This prevents tissue 2900 from being cut that is not stapled.\n* the other function performed by the tissue stops 2344 is to axially align the anvil 2340 relative to the elongate channel 2302 and ultimately to the cartridge 2500 received therein.\n* the tissue stops 2344 serve to contact corresponding alignment surfaces 2720 on the side of the elongate channel 2302 and serve to laterally align the anvil 2340 relative to the elongate channel 2302 when the anvil 2340 is closed and clamping tissue 2900 such that the staple-forming pockets 2350 in the bottom surface 2341 of the anvil 2340 are laterally aligned with the corresponding staple-receiving pockets 2512 in the cartridge 2500 . See FIGS. 69 and 73 .\n* FIGS. 62 - 68 illustrate the closure nut 2440 in an open position.\n* the closure nut 2440 when in the open position, the closure nut 2440 is located such that the hook arm 2346 is permitted to move to various positions relative thereto that enable the anvil 2340 to pivot open to permit tissue 2900 to be inserted between the anvil 2340 and the elongated channel 2302 and cartridge 2500 seated therein.\n* the distal end 2467 of the retainer arm 2466 that is attached to the closure lock spring 2460 is in contact with a ramp surface 2321 formed on the proximal end of the knife assembly 2320 . See FIG. 64 .\n* the end of the retainer arm 2466 contacts the ramp surface 2321 on the proximal end of the knife assembly 2320 and serves to cause the retainer arm 2466 to bias the upper portion 2462 of the closure lock spring 2460 downward toward the bottom of the elongate channel 2302 .\n* the upper portion 2462 of the closure lock spring 2460 is permitted to spring upward to enable the retainer lip 2464 to engage the closure nut 2440 as will be further discussed below.\n* the end effector 2300 when the end effector 2300 is in the open positions depicted in FIGS. 62 - 68 , the user can install a disposable cartridge assembly 2500 in the elongate member 2302 .\n* the anvil 2340 may be able to move axially, laterally and vertically relative to the elongate channel 2302 .\n* the closure thread 2406 thereon threadably drives the closure nut 2440 in the proximal direction (direction âBâ in FIG. 50 ) until the closure threads 2406 disengage the threaded hole 2442 in the closure nut 2440 . See FIG. 55 .\n* closure hook 2346 on the anvil closure arm 2347 rides up the ramp 2444 of the closure nut 2440 until it rides into the radiused portion 2446 and contacts the closure tab 2448 .\n* Such movement of the closure nut 2440 serves to âpullâ the anvil 2340 to the closed position. See FIGS. 69 - 71 .\n* the trunnion tabs 2342 are in abutting contact with the proximal end portion 2702 of the pivot holes 2700 and the retainer lip 2464 of the closure lock spring has engaged the distal end 2441 of the closure nut 2440 to retain the anvil 2340 in the fully closed and axially aligned position.\n* the anvil 2340 When also in that position, by virtue of the contact of the tissue stops 2344 with the alignment surfaces 2720 on the side walls 2309 of the elongate channel 2302 , the anvil 2340 is laterally aligned with the elongate channel 2302 so that the staple forming pockets 2350 in the anvil 2340 are laterally aligned with corresponding the staple-receiving pockets 2512 in the cartridge 2500 .\n* the proximal end 2449 of the closure nut 2440 contacts the thrust bearing 2434 which forces the clutch plate 2420 in the proximal direction against the force of clutch opening spring 2432 . Further travel of the closure nut 2440 in the proximal direction drives the clutch plate 2420 onto the tapered sections 2416 of the tapered clutch member 2412 which causes the male splines 2418 therein to engage the female splines 2408 on the distal drive shaft portion 2402 .\n* the knife assembly 2320 As the knife assembly 2320 is driven distally, it cuts the tissue and the cams 2328 on the wedge sled 2326 serve to drive the staple supporting drivers 2532 upward which drive the staples 2534 toward the anvil 2340 . As the legs 2536 of the staples 2534 are driven into the corresponding staple-forming pockets 2350 in the anvil 2340 , they are folded over. See FIG. 49 .\n* the retainer lip 2464 serves to retain the clutch assembly 2410 engaged with the distal drive shaft portion 2402 until the knife assembly 2320 once again returns to contact the distal end 2467 of the retainer arm 2464 .\n* the knife assembly 2320 After the knife assembly 2320 has been driven to its final distal position as shown in FIG. 72 , it activates a conventional sensor or contact 2313 mounted within the elongate channel 2302 and signals the control motor to stop driving the drive shaft 2402 . See FIG. 76 .\n* a conventional sensor or contact 2313 mounted within the elongate channel 2302 and signals the control motor to stop driving the drive shaft 2402 . See FIG. 76 .\n* the control system 2610 housed within the handle 2006 could automatically reverse the drive motor 2600 therein and cause the drive shaft portion 2402 and knife screw to reverse direction (e.g., move in the proximal âBâ direction).\n* the control system 2610 may simply stop the drive motor 2600 and then require the surgeon to activate a button 2030 to cause the motor 2600 to reverse.\n* the control system 2610 may institute a predetermined timed delay between the time that the reversing sensor 2313 is activated and the time that the motor 2600 is reversed.\n* the closure threads 2406 on the drive shaft 2402 begin to screw back into the threaded hole portion 2442 in the closure nut 2440 .\n* the ramp surface 2321 of the knife assembly 2320 again contacts the distal end 2467 of the retainer arm 2466 which serves to bias the upper portion 2462 of the closure lock spring 2460 toward the bottom of the elongate channel 2302 to permit the retainer lip 2464 to disengage from the distal end 2441 of the closure nut 2440 thereby permitting the clutch opening spring 2432 to bias the clutch assembly 2410 and closure nut 2440 distally.\n* a second conventional sensor or contact 2315 is mounted within the proximal end portion 2305 of the elongate channel 2302 for sensing when the closure nut 2440 is in the open position and communicates with the motor to cause it to stop.

The illustrated embodiment is an endoscopic instrument and, in general, the embodiments of the instrument **10** described herein are endoscopic surgical cutting and fastening instruments. It should be noted, however, that according to other embodiments of the present invention, the instrument may be a non-endoscopic surgical cutting and fastening instrument, such as a laparoscopic instrument.\nThe surgical instrument **10** depicted in FIGS. **1** and **2** comprises a handle **6** , a shaft **8** , and an articulating end effector **12** pivotally connected to the shaft **8** at an articulation pivot **14**. An articulation control **16** may be provided adjacent to the handle **6** to effect rotation of the end effector **12** about the articulation pivot **14**. In the illustrated embodiment, the end effector **12** is configured to act as an endocutter for clamping, severing and stapling tissue, although, in other embodiments, different types of end effectors may be used, such as end effectors for other types of surgical devices, such as graspers, cutters, staplers, clip appliers, access devices, drug/gene therapy devices, ultrasound, RF or laser devices, etc.\nThe handle **6** of the instrument **10** may include a closure trigger **18** and a firing trigger **20** for actuating the end effector **12**. It will be appreciated that instruments having end effectors directed to different surgical tasks may have different numbers or types of triggers or other suitable controls for operating the end effector **12**. The end effector **12** is shown separated from the handle **6** by a preferably elongate shaft **8**. In one embodiment, a clinician or operator of the instrument **10** may articulate the end effector **12** relative to the shaft **8** by utilizing the articulation control **16** , as described in more detail in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/329,020, filed Jan. 10, 2006, entitled SURGICAL INSTRUMENT HAVING AN ARTICULATING END EFFECTOR, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,670,334, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nThe end effector **12** includes in this example, among other things, a staple channel **22** and a pivotally translatable clamping member, such as an anvil **24** , which are maintained at a spacing that assures effective stapling and severing of tissue clamped in the end effector **12**. The handle **6** includes a pistol grip **26** towards which a closure trigger **18** is pivotally drawn by the clinician to cause clamping or closing of the anvil **24** toward the staple channel **22** of the end effector **12** to thereby clamp tissue positioned between the anvil **24** and channel **22**. The firing trigger **20** is farther outboard of the closure trigger **18**. Once the closure trigger **18** is locked in the closure position as further described below, the firing trigger **20** may rotate slightly toward the pistol grip **26** so that it can be reached by the operator using one hand. Then the operator may pivotally draw the firing trigger **20** toward the pistol grip **12** to cause the stapling and severing of clamped tissue in the end effector **12**. In other embodiments, different types of clamping members besides the anvil **24** could be used, such as, for example, an opposing jaw, etc.\nIt will be appreciated that the terms âproximalâ and âdistalâ are used herein with reference to a clinician gripping the handle **6** of an instrument **10**. Thus, the end effector **12** is distal with respect to the more proximal handle **6**. It will be further appreciated that, for convenience and clarity, spatial terms such as âverticalâ and âhorizontalâ are used herein with respect to the drawings. However, surgical instruments are used in many orientations and positions, and these terms are not intended to be limiting and absolute.\nThe closure trigger **18** may be actuated first. Once the clinician is satisfied with the positioning of the end effector **12** , the clinician may draw back the closure trigger **18** to its fully closed, locked position proximate to the pistol grip **26**. The firing trigger **20** may then be actuated. The firing trigger **20** returns to the open position (shown in FIGS. **1** and **2** ) when the clinician removes pressure, as described more fully below. A release button on the handle **6** , when depressed may release the locked closure trigger **18**. The release button may be implemented in various forms such as, for example, as a slide release button **160** shown in FIG. **14** , and/or button **172** shown in FIG. **16** .\nFIG. **3** is an exploded view of the end effector **12** according to various embodiments. As shown in the illustrated embodiment, the end effector **12** may include, in addition to the previously-mentioned channel **22** and anvil **24** , a cutting instrument **32** , a sled **33** , a staple cartridge **34** that is removably seated in the channel **22** , and a helical screw shaft **36**. The cutting instrument **32** may be, for example, a knife. The anvil **24** may be pivotably opened and closed at a pivot point **25** connected to the proximate end of the channel **22**. The anvil **24** may also include a tab **27** at its proximate end that is inserted into a component of the mechanical closure system (described further below) to open and close the anvil **24**. When the closure trigger **18** is actuated, that is, drawn in by a user of the instrument **10** , the anvil **24** may pivot about the pivot point **25** into the clamped or closed position. If clamping of the end effector **12** is satisfactory, the operator may actuate the firing trigger **20** , which, as explained in more detail below, causes the knife **32** and sled **33** to travel longitudinally along the channel **22** , thereby cutting tissue clamped within the end effector **12**. The movement of the sled **33** along the channel **22** causes the staples of the staple cartridge **34** to be driven through the severed tissue and against the closed anvil **24** , which turns the staples to fasten the severed tissue. In various embodiments, the sled **33** may be an integral component of the cartridge **34**. U.S. Pat. No. 6,978,921, entitled SURGICAL STAPLING INSTRUMENT INCORPORATING AN E-BEAM FIRING MECHANISM, which is incorporated herein by reference, provides more details about such two-stroke cutting and fastening instruments. The sled **33** may be part of the cartridge **34** , such that when the knife **32** retracts following the cutting operation, the sled **33** does not retract.\nIt should be noted that although the embodiments of the instrument **10** described herein employ an end effector **12** that staples the severed tissue, in other embodiments different techniques for fastening or sealing the severed tissue may be used. For example, end effectors that use RF energy or adhesives to fasten the severed tissue may also be used. U.S. Pat. No. 5,709,680 entitled ELECTROSURGICAL HEMOSTATIC DEVICE, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,688,270 entitled ELECTROSURGICAL HEMOSTATIC DEVICE WITH RECESSED AND/OR OFFSET ELECTRODES, which are incorporated herein by reference, disclose an endoscopic cutting instrument that uses RF energy to seal the severed tissue. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/267,811, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,673,783, and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/267,383, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,607,557, which are also incorporated herein by reference, disclose an endoscopic cutting instrument that uses adhesives to fasten the severed tissue. Accordingly, although the description herein refers to cutting/stapling operations and the like below, it should be recognized that this is an exemplary embodiment and is not meant to be limiting. Other tissue-fastening techniques may also be used.\nFIGS. **4** and **5** are exploded views and FIG. **6** is a side view of the end effector **12** and shaft **8** according to various embodiments. As shown in the illustrated embodiment, the shaft **8** may include a proximate closure tube **40** and a distal closure tube **42** pivotably linked by a pivot links **44**. The distal closure tube **42** includes an opening **45** into which the tab **27** on the anvil **24** is inserted in order to open and close the anvil **24** , as further described below. Disposed inside the  closure tubes **40** , **42** may be a proximate spine tube **46**. Disposed inside the proximate spine tube **46** may be a main rotational (or proximate) drive shaft **48** that communicates with a secondary (or distal) drive shaft **50** via a bevel gear assembly **52**. The secondary drive shaft **50** is connected to a drive gear **54** that engages a proximate drive gear **56** of the helical screw shaft **36**. The vertical bevel gear **52** _b_ may sit and pivot in an opening **57** in the distal end of the proximate spine tube **46**. A distal spine tube **58** may be used to enclose the secondary drive shaft **50** and the drive gears **54** , **56**. Collectively, the main drive shaft **48** , the secondary drive shaft **50** , and the articulation assembly (e.g., the bevel gear assembly **52** _a_ -_c_) are sometimes referred to herein as the âmain drive shaft assembly.â\nA bearing **38** , positioned at a distal end of the staple channel **22** , receives the helical drive screw **36** , allowing the helical drive screw **36** to freely rotate with respect to the channel **22**. The helical screw shaft **36** may interface a threaded opening (not shown) of the knife **32** such that rotation of the shaft **36** causes the knife **32** to translate distally or proximately (depending on the direction of the rotation) through the staple channel **22**. Accordingly, when the main drive shaft **48** is caused to rotate by actuation of the firing trigger **20** (as explained in more detail below), the bevel gear assembly **52** _a_ -_c_ causes the secondary drive shaft **50** to rotate, which in turn, because of the engagement of the drive gears **54** , **56** , causes the helical screw shaft **36** to rotate, which causes the knife driving member **32** to travel longitudinally along the channel **22** to cut any tissue clamped within the end effector. The sled **33** may be made of, for example, plastic, and may have a sloped distal surface. As the sled **33** traverse the channel **22** , the sloped forward surface may push up or drive the staples in the staple cartridge through the clamped tissue and against the anvil **24**. The anvil **24** turns the staples, thereby stapling the severed tissue. When the knife **32** is retracted, the knife **32** and sled **33** may become disengaged, thereby leaving the sled **33** at the distal end of the channel **22**.\nAs described above, because of the lack of user feedback for the cutting/stapling operation, there is a general lack of acceptance among physicians of motor-driven endocutters where the cutting/stapling operation is actuated by merely pressing a button. In contrast, embodiments of the present invention provide a motor-driven endocutter with user-feedback of the deployment, force, and/or position of the cutting instrument in the end effector.\nFIGS. **7** -**10** illustrate an exemplary embodiment of a motor-driven endocutter, and in particular the handle thereof, that provides user-feedback regarding the deployment and loading force of the cutting instrument in the end effector. In addition, the embodiment may use power provided by the user in retracting the firing trigger **20** to power the device (a so-called âpower assistâ mode). As shown in the illustrated embodiment, the handle **6** includes exterior  lower side pieces **59** , **60** and exterior  upper side pieces **61** , **62** that fit together to form, in general, the exterior of the handle **6**. A battery **64** , such as a Li ion battery, may be provided in the pistol grip portion **26** of the handle **6**. The battery **64** powers a motor **65** disposed in an upper portion of the pistol grip portion **26** of the handle **6**. According to various embodiments, the motor **65** may be a DC brushed driving motor having a maximum rotation of, approximately, 5000 RPM. The motor **64** may drive a 90Â° bevel gear assembly **66** comprising a first bevel gear **68** and a second bevel gear **70**. The bevel gear assembly **66** may drive a planetary gear assembly **72**. The planetary gear assembly **72** may include a pinion gear **74** connected to a drive shaft **76**. The pinion gear **74** may drive a mating ring gear **78** that drives a helical gear drum **80** via a drive shaft **82**. A ring **84** may be threaded on the helical gear drum **80**. Thus, when the motor **65** rotates, the ring **84** is caused to travel along the helical gear drum **80** by means of the interposed bevel gear assembly **66** , planetary gear assembly **72** and ring gear **78**.\nThe handle **6** may also include a run motor sensor **110** in communication with the firing trigger **20** to detect when the firing trigger **20** has been drawn in (or âclosedâ) toward the pistol grip portion **26** of the handle **6** by the operator to thereby actuate the cutting/stapling operation by the end effector **12**. The sensor **110** may be a proportional sensor such as, for example, a rheostat or variable resistor. When the firing trigger **20** is drawn in, the sensor **110** detects the movement, and sends an electrical signal indicative of the voltage (or power) to be supplied to the motor **65**. When the sensor **110** is a variable resistor or the like, the rotation of the motor **65** may be generally proportional to the amount of movement of the firing trigger **20**. That is, if the operator only draws or closes the firing trigger **20** in a little bit, the rotation of the motor **65** is relatively low. When the firing trigger **20** is fully drawn in (or in the fully closed position), the rotation of the motor **65** is at its maximum. In other words, the harder the user pulls on the firing trigger **20** , the more voltage is applied to the motor **65** , causing greater rates of rotation.\nThe handle **6** may include a middle handle piece **104** adjacent to the upper portion of the firing trigger **20**. The handle **6** also may comprise a bias spring **112** connected between posts on the middle handle piece **104** and the firing trigger **20**. The bias spring **112** may bias the firing trigger **20** to its fully open position. In that way, when the operator releases the firing trigger **20** , the bias spring **112** will pull the firing trigger **20** to its open position, thereby removing actuation of the sensor **110** , thereby stopping rotation of the motor **65**. Moreover, by virtue of the bias spring **112** , any time a user closes the firing trigger **20** , the user will experience resistance to the closing operation, thereby providing the user with feedback as to the amount of rotation exerted by the motor **65**. Further, the operator could stop retracting the firing trigger **20** to thereby remove force from the sensor **100** , to thereby stop the motor **65**. As such, the user may stop the deployment of the end effector **12** , thereby providing a measure of control of the cutting/fastening operation to the operator.\nThe distal end of the helical gear drum **80** includes a distal drive shaft **120** that drives a ring gear **122** , which mates with a pinion gear **124**. The pinion gear **124** is connected to the main drive shaft **48** of the main drive shaft assembly. In that way, rotation of the motor **65** causes the main drive shaft assembly to rotate, which causes actuation of the end effector **12** , as described above.\nThe ring **84** threaded on the helical gear drum **80** may include a post **86** that is disposed within a slot **88** of a slotted arm **90**. The slotted arm **90** has an opening **92** its opposite end **94** that receives a pivot pin **96** that is connected between the handle  exterior side pieces **59** , **60**. The pivot pin **96** is also disposed through an opening **100** in the firing trigger **20** and an opening **102** in the middle handle piece **104**.\nIn addition, the handle **6** may include a reverse motor (or end-of-stroke sensor) **130** and a stop motor (or beginning-of-stroke) sensor **142**. In various embodiments, the reverse motor sensor **130** may be a limit switch located at the distal end of the helical gear drum **80** such that the ring **84** threaded on the helical gear drum **80** contacts and trips the reverse motor sensor **130** when the ring **84** reaches the distal end of the helical gear drum **80**. The reverse motor sensor **130** , when activated, sends a signal to the motor **65** to reverse its rotation direction, thereby withdrawing the knife **32** of the end effector **12** following the cutting operation.\nThe stop motor sensor **142** may be, for example, a normally-closed limit switch. In various embodiments, it may be located at the proximate end of the helical gear drum **80** so that the ring **84** trips the switch **142** when the ring **84** reaches the proximate end of the helical gear drum **80**.\nIn operation, when an operator of the instrument **10** pulls back the firing trigger **20** , the sensor **110** detects the deployment of the firing trigger **20** and sends a signal to the motor **65** to cause forward rotation of the motor **65** at, for example, a rate proportional to how hard the operator pulls back the firing trigger **20**. The forward rotation of the motor **65** in turn causes the ring gear **78** at the distal end of the planetary gear assembly **72** to rotate, thereby causing the helical gear drum **80** to rotate, causing the ring **84** threaded on the helical gear drum **80** to travel distally along the helical gear drum **80**. The rotation of the helical gear drum **80** also drives the main drive shaft assembly as described above, which in turn causes deployment of the knife **32** in the end effector **12**. That is, the knife **32** and sled **33** are caused to traverse the channel **22** longitudinally, thereby cutting tissue clamped in the end effector **12**. Also, the stapling operation of the end effector **12** is caused to happen in embodiments where a stapling-type end effector is used.\nBy the time the cutting/stapling operation of the end effector **12** is complete, the ring **84** on the helical gear drum **80** will have reached the distal end of the helical gear drum **80** , thereby causing the reverse motor sensor **130** to be tripped, which sends a signal to the motor **65** to cause the motor **65** to reverse its rotation. This in turn causes the knife **32** to retract, and also causes the ring **84** on the helical gear drum **80** to move back to the proximate end of the helical gear drum **80**.\nThe middle handle piece **104** includes a backside shoulder **106** that engages the slotted arm **90** as best shown in FIGS. **8** and **9** . The middle handle piece **104** also has a forward motion stop **107** that engages the firing trigger **20**. The movement of the slotted arm **90** is controlled, as explained above, by rotation of the motor **65**. When the slotted arm **90** rotates CCW as the ring **84** travels from the proximate end of the helical gear drum **80** to the distal end, the middle handle piece **104** will be free to rotate CCW. Thus, as the user draws in the firing trigger **20** , the firing trigger **20** will engage the forward motion stop **107** of the middle handle piece **104** , causing the middle handle piece **104** to rotate CCW. Due to the backside shoulder **106** engaging the slotted arm however, the middle handle piece **104** will only be able to rotate CCW as far as the slotted arm **90** permits. In that way, if the motor **65** should stop rotating for some reason, the slotted arm **90** will stop rotating, and the user will not be able to further draw in the firing trigger **20** because the middle handle piece **104** will not be free to rotate CCW due to the slotted arm **90**.\nFIGS. **41** and **42** illustrate two states of a variable sensor that may be used as the run motor sensor **110** according to various embodiments of the present invention. The sensor **110** may include a face portion **280** , a first electrode (A) **282** , a second electrode (B) **284** , and a compressible dielectric material **286** (e.g., EAP) between the  electrodes **282** , **284**. The sensor **110** may be positioned such that the face portion **280** contacts the firing trigger **20** when retracted. Accordingly, when the firing trigger **20** is retracted, the dielectric material **286** is compressed, as shown in FIG. **42** , such that the  electrodes **282** , **284** are closer together. Since the distance âbâ between the  electrodes **282** , **284** is directly related to the impedance between the  electrodes **282** , **284** , the greater the distance the more impedance, and the closer the distance the less impedance. In that way, the amount that the dielectric **286** is compressed due to retraction of the firing trigger **20** (denoted as force âFâ in FIG. **42** ) is proportional to the impedance between the  electrodes **282** , **284** , which can be used to proportionally control the motor **65**.\nComponents of an exemplary closure system for closing (or clamping) the anvil **24** of the end effector **12** by retracting the closure trigger **18** are also shown in FIGS. **7** -**10** . In the illustrated embodiment, the closure system includes a yoke **250** connected to the closure trigger **18** by a pin **251** that is inserted through aligned openings in both the closure trigger **18** and the yoke **250**. A pivot pin **252** , about which the closure trigger **18** pivots, is inserted through another opening in the closure trigger **18** which is offset from where the pin **251** is inserted through the closure trigger **18**. Thus, retraction of the closure trigger **18** causes the upper part of the closure trigger **18** , to which the yoke **250** is attached via the pin **251** , to rotate CCW. The distal end of the yoke **250** is connected, via a pin **254** , to a first closure bracket **256**. The first closure bracket **256** connects to a second closure bracket **258**. Collectively, the  closure brackets **256** , **258** define an opening in which the proximate end of the proximate closure tube **40** (see FIG. **4** ) is seated and held such that longitudinal movement of the  closure brackets **256** , **258** causes longitudinal motion by the proximate closure tube **40**. The instrument **10** also includes a closure rod **260** disposed inside the proximate closure tube **40**. The closure rod **260** may include a window **261** into which a post **263** on one of the handle exterior pieces, such as exterior lower side piece **59** in the illustrated embodiment, is disposed to fixedly connect the closure rod **260** to the handle **6**. In that way, the proximate closure tube **40** is capable of moving longitudinally relative to the closure rod **260**. The closure rod **260** may also include a distal collar **267** that fits into a cavity **269** in proximate spine tube **46** and is retained therein by a cap **271** (see FIG. **4** ).\nIn operation, when the yoke **250** rotates due to retraction of the closure trigger **18** , the  closure brackets **256** , **258** cause the proximate closure tube **40** to move distally (i.e., away from the handle end of the instrument **10**), which causes the distal closure tube **42** to move distally, which causes the anvil **24** to rotate about the pivot point **25** into the clamped or closed position. When the closure trigger **18** is unlocked from the locked position, the proximate closure tube **40** is caused to slide proximately, which causes the distal closure tube **42** to slide proximately, which, by virtue of the tab **27** being inserted in the window **45** of the distal closure tube **42** , causes the anvil **24** to pivot about the pivot point **25** into the open or unclamped position. In that way, by retracting and locking the closure trigger **18** , an operator may clamp tissue between the anvil **24** and channel **22** , and may unclamp the tissue following the cutting/stapling operation by unlocking the closure trigger **20** from the locked position.\nFIG. **11** is a schematic diagram of an electrical circuit of the instrument **10** according to various embodiments of the present invention. When an operator initially pulls in the firing trigger **20** after locking the closure trigger **18** , the sensor **110** is activated, allowing current to flow there through. If the normally-open reverse motor sensor switch **130** is open (meaning the end of the end effector stroke has not been reached), current will flow to a single pole, double throw relay **132**. Since the reverse motor sensor switch **130** is not closed, the inductor **134** of the relay **132** will not be energized, so the relay **132** will be in its non-energized state. The circuit also includes a cartridge lockout sensor **136**. If the end effector **12** includes a staple cartridge **34** , the sensor **136** will be in the closed state, allowing current to flow. Otherwise, if the end effector **12** does not include a staple cartridge **34** , the sensor **136** will be open, thereby preventing the battery **64** from powering the motor **65**.\nWhen the staple cartridge **34** is present, the sensor **136** is closed, which energizes a single pole, single throw relay **138**. When the relay **138** is energized, current flows through the relay **136** , through the variable resistor sensor **110** , and to the motor **65** via a double pole, double throw relay **140** , thereby powering the motor **65** and allowing it to rotate in the forward direction.\nWhen the end effector **12** reaches the end of its stroke, the reverse motor sensor **130** will be activated, thereby closing the switch **130** and energizing the relay **134**. This causes the relay **134** to assume its energized state (not shown in FIG. **13** ), which causes current to bypass the cartridge lockout sensor **136** and variable resistor **110** , and instead causes current to flow to both the normally-closed double pole, double throw relay **142** and back to the motor **65** , but in a manner, via the relay **140** , that causes the motor **65** to reverse its rotational direction.\nBecause the stop motor sensor switch **142** is normally-closed, current will flow back to the relay **134** to keep it closed until the switch **142** opens. When the knife **32** is fully retracted, the stop motor sensor switch **142** is activated, causing the switch **142** to open, thereby removing power from the motor **65**.\nIn other embodiments, rather than a proportional-type sensor **110** , an on-off type sensor could be used. In such embodiments, the rate of rotation of the motor **65** would not be proportional to the force applied by the operator. Rather, the motor **65** would generally rotate at a constant rate. But the operator would still experience force feedback because the firing trigger **20** is geared into the gear drive train.\nFIG. **12** is a side-view of the handle **6** of a power-assist motorized endocutter according to another embodiment. The embodiment of FIG. **12** is similar to that of FIGS. **7** -**10** except that in the embodiment of FIG. **12** , there is not slotted arm connected to the ring **84** threaded on the helical gear drum **80**. Instead, in the embodiment of FIG. **12** , the ring **84** includes a sensor portion **114** that moves with the ring **84** as the ring **84** advances down (and back) on the helical gear drum **80**. The sensor portion **114** includes a notch **116**. The reverse motor sensor **130** may be located at the distal end of the notch **116** and the stop motor sensor **142** may be located at the proximate end of the notch **116**. As the ring **84** moves down the helical gear drum **80** (and back), the sensor portion **114** moves with it. Further, as shown in FIG. **12** , the middle piece **104** may have an arm **118** that extends into the notch **12**.\nIn operation, as an operator of the instrument **10** retracts in the firing trigger **20** toward the pistol grip **26** , the run motor sensor **110** detects the motion and sends a signal to power the motor **65** , which causes, among other things, the helical gear drum **80** to rotate. As the helical gear drum **80** rotates, the ring **84** threaded on the helical gear drum **80** advances (or retracts, depending on the rotation). Also, due to the pulling in of the firing trigger **20** , the middle piece **104** is caused to rotate CCW with the firing trigger **20** due to the forward motion stop **107** that engages the firing trigger **20**. The CCW rotation of the middle piece **104** cause the arm **118** to rotate CCW with the sensor portion **114** of the ring **84** such that the arm **118** stays disposed in the notch **116**. When the ring **84** reaches the distal end of the helical gear drum **80** , the arm **118** will contact and thereby trip the reverse motor sensor **130**. Similarly, when the ring **84** reaches the proximate end of the helical gear drum **80** , the arm will contact and thereby trip the stop motor sensor **142**. Such actions may reverse and stop the motor **65** , respectively, as described above.\nFIG. **13** is a side-view of the handle **6** of a power-assist motorized endocutter according to another embodiment. The embodiment of FIG. **13** is similar to that of FIGS. **7** -**10** except that in the embodiment of FIG. **13** , there is no slot in the arm **90**. Instead, the ring **84** threaded on the helical gear drum **80** includes a vertical channel **126**. Instead of a slot, the arm **90** includes a post **128** that is disposed in the channel **126**. As the helical gear drum **80** rotates, the ring **84** threaded on the helical gear drum advances (or retracts, depending on the rotation). The arm **90** rotates CCW as the ring **84** advances due to the post **128** being disposed in the channel **126** , as shown in FIG. **13** .\nAs mentioned above, in using a two-stroke motorized instrument, the operator first pulls back and locks the closure trigger **18**. FIGS. **14** and **15** show one embodiment of a way to lock the closure trigger **18** to the pistol grip portion **26** of the handle **6**. In the illustrated embodiment, the pistol grip portion **26** includes a hook **150** that is biased to rotate CCW about a pivot point **151** by a torsion spring **152**. Also, the closure trigger **18** includes a closure bar **154**. As the operator draws in the closure trigger **18** , the closure bar **154** engages a sloped portion **156** of the hook **150** , thereby rotating the hook **150** upward (or CW in FIGS. **12** -**13** ) until the closure bar **154** completely passes the sloped portion **156** passes into a recessed notch **158** of the hook **150** , which locks the closure trigger **18** in place. The operator may release the closure trigger **18** by pushing down on a slide button release **160** on the back or opposite side of the pistol grip portion **26**. Pushing down the slide button release **160** rotates the hook **150** CW such that the closure bar **154** is released from the recessed notch **158**.\nFIG. **16** shows another closure trigger locking mechanism according to various embodiments. In the embodiment of FIG. **16** , the closure trigger **18** includes a wedge **160** having an arrow-head portion **161**. The arrow-head portion **161** is biased downward (or CW) by a leaf spring **162**. The wedge **160** and leaf spring **162** may be made from, for example, molded plastic. When the closure trigger **18** is retracted, the arrow-head portion **161** is inserted through an opening **164** in the pistol grip portion **26** of the handle **6**. A lower chamfered surface **166** of the arrow-head portion **161** engages a lower sidewall **168** of the opening **164** , forcing the arrow-head portion **161** to rotate CCW. Eventually the lower chamfered surface **166** fully passes the lower sidewall **168** , removing the CCW force on the arrow-head portion **161** , causing the lower sidewall **168** to slip into a locked position in a notch **170** behind the arrow-head portion **161**.\nTo unlock the closure trigger **18** , a user presses down on a button **172** on the opposite side of the closure trigger **18** , causing the arrow-head portion **161** to rotate CCW and allowing the arrow-head portion **161** to slide out of the opening **164**.\nFIGS. **17** -**22** show a closure trigger locking mechanism according to another embodiment. As shown in this embodiment, the closure trigger **18** includes a flexible longitudinal arm **176** that includes a lateral pin **178** extending therefrom. The arm **176** and pin **178** may be made from molded plastic, for example. The pistol grip portion **26** of the handle **6** includes an opening **180** with a laterally extending wedge **182** disposed therein. When the closure trigger **18** is retracted, the pin **178** engages the wedge **182** , and the pin **178** is forced downward (i.e., the arm **176** is rotated CW) by the lower surface **184** of the wedge **182** , as shown in FIGS. **17** and **18** . When the pin **178** fully passes the lower surface **184** , the CW force on the arm **176** is removed, and the pin **178** is rotated CCW such that the pin **178** comes to rest in a notch **186** behind the wedge **182** , as shown in FIG. **19** , thereby locking the closure trigger **18**. The pin **178** is further held in place in the locked position by a flexible stop **188** extending from the wedge **184**.\nTo unlock the closure trigger **18** , the operator may further squeeze the closure trigger **18** , causing the pin **178** to engage a sloped backwall **190** of the opening **180** , forcing the pin **178** upward past the flexible stop **188** , as shown in FIGS. **20** and **21** . The pin **178** is then free to travel out an upper channel **192** in the opening **180** such that the closure trigger **18** is no longer locked to the pistol grip portion **26** , as shown in FIG. **22** .\nFIGS. **23** A-B show a universal joint (âu-jointâ) **195**. The second piece **195** -**2** of the u-joint **195** rotates in a horizontal plane in which the first piece **195** -**1** lies. FIG. **23** A shows the u-joint **195** in a linear (180Â°) orientation and FIG. **23** B shows the u-joint **195** at approximately a 150Â° orientation. The u-joint **195** may be used instead of the bevel gears **52** _a_ -_c_(see FIG. **4** , for example) at the articulation point **14** of the main drive shaft assembly to articulate the end effector **12**. FIGS. **24** A-B show a torsion cable **197** that may be used in lieu of both the bevel gears **52** _a_ -_c_ and the u-joint **195** to realize articulation of the end effector **12**.\nFIGS. **25** -**31** illustrate another embodiment of a motorized, two-stroke surgical cutting and fastening instrument **10** with power assist according to another embodiment of the present invention. The embodiment of FIGS. **25** -**31** is similar to that of FIGS. **6** -**10** except that instead of the helical gear drum **80** , the embodiment of FIGS. **23** -**28** includes an alternative gear drive assembly. The embodiment of FIGS. **25** -**31** includes a gear box assembly **200** including a number of gears disposed in a frame **201** , wherein the gears are connected between the planetary gear **72** and the pinion gear **124** at the proximate end of the drive shaft **48**. As explained further below, the gear box assembly **200** provides feedback to the user via the firing trigger **20** regarding the deployment and loading force of the end effector **12**. Also, the user may provide power to the system via the gear box assembly **200** to assist the deployment of the end effector **12**. In that sense, like the embodiments described above, the embodiment of FIGS. **23** -**32** is another power assist, motorized instrument **10** that provides feedback to the user regarding the loading force experienced by the cutting instrument.\nIn the illustrated embodiment, the firing trigger **20** includes two pieces: a main body portion **202** and a stiffening portion **204**. The main body portion **202** may be made of plastic, for example, and the stiffening portion **204** may be made out of a more rigid material, such as metal. In the illustrated embodiment, the stiffening portion **204** is adjacent to the main body portion **202** , but according to other embodiments, the stiffening portion **204** could be disposed inside the main body portion **202**. A pivot pin **209** may be inserted through openings in the firing  trigger pieces **202** , **204** and may be the point about which the firing trigger **20** rotates. In addition, a spring **222** may bias the firing trigger **20** to rotate in a CCW direction. The spring **222** may have a distal end connected to a pin **224** that is connected to the  pieces **202** , **204** of the firing trigger **20**. The proximate end of the spring **222** may be connected to one of the handle exterior  lower side pieces **59** , **60**.\nIn the illustrated embodiment, both the main body portion **202** and the stiffening portion **204** includes gear portions **206** , **208** (respectively) at their upper end portions. The  gear portions **206** , **208** engage a gear in the gear box assembly **200** , as explained below, to drive the main drive shaft assembly and to provide feedback to the user regarding the deployment of the end effector **12**.\nThe gear box assembly **200** may include as shown, in the illustrated embodiment, six (6) gears. A first gear **210** of the gear box assembly **200** engages the  gear portions **206** , **208** of the firing trigger **20**. In addition, the first gear **210** engages a smaller second gear **212** , the smaller second gear **212** being coaxial with a large third gear **214**. The third gear **214** engages a smaller fourth gear **216** , the smaller fourth gear being coaxial with a fifth gear **218**. The fifth gear **218** is a 90Â° bevel gear that engages a mating 90Â° bevel gear **220** (best shown in FIG. **31** ) that is connected to the pinion gear **124** that drives the main drive shaft **48**.\nIn operation, when the user retracts the firing trigger **20** , a run motor sensor (not shown) is activated, which may provide a signal to the motor **65** to rotate at a rate proportional to the extent or force with which the operator is retracting the firing trigger **20**. This causes the motor **65** to rotate at a speed proportional to the signal from the sensor. The sensor is not shown for this embodiment, but it could be similar to the run motor sensor **110** described above. The sensor could be located in the handle **6** such that it is depressed when the firing trigger **20** is retracted. Also, instead of a proportional-type sensor, an on/off type sensor may be used.\nRotation of the motor **65** causes the bevel gears **66** , **70** to rotate, which causes the planetary gear **72** to rotate, which causes, via the drive shaft **76** , the ring gear **122** to rotate. The ring gear **122** meshes with the pinion gear **124** , which is connected to the main drive shaft **48**. Thus, rotation of the pinion gear **124** drives the main drive shaft **48** , which causes actuation of the cutting/stapling operation of the end effector **12**.\nForward rotation of the pinion gear **124** in turn causes the bevel gear **220** to rotate, which causes, by way of the rest of the gears of the gear box assembly **200** , the first gear **210** to rotate. The first gear **210** engages the  gear portions **206** , **208** of the firing trigger **20** , thereby causing the firing trigger **20** to rotate CCW when the motor **65** provides forward drive for the end effector **12** (and to rotate CCW when the motor **65** rotates in reverse to retract the end effector **12**). In that way, the user experiences feedback regarding loading force and deployment of the end effector **12** by way of the user's grip on the firing trigger **20**. Thus, when the user retracts the firing trigger **20** , the operator will experience a resistance related to the load force experienced by the end effector **12**. Similarly, when the operator releases the firing trigger **20** after the cutting/stapling operation so that it can return to its original position, the user will experience a CW rotation force from the firing trigger **20** that is generally proportional to the reverse speed of the motor **65**.\nIt should also be noted that in this embodiment the user can apply force (either in lieu of or in addition to the force from the motor **65**) to actuate the main drive shaft assembly (and hence the cutting/stapling operation of the end effector **12**) through retracting the firing trigger **20**. That is, retracting the firing trigger **20** causes the  gear portions **206** , **208** to rotate CCW, which causes the gears of the gear box assembly **200** to rotate, thereby causing the pinion gear **124** to rotate, which causes the main drive shaft **48** to rotate.\nAlthough not shown in FIGS. **25** -**31** , the instrument **10** may further include reverse motor and stop motor sensors. As described above, the reverse motor and stop motor sensors may detect, respectively, the end of the cutting stroke (full deployment of the knife/sled driving member **32**) and the end of retraction operation (full retraction of the knife/sled driving member **32**). A similar circuit to that described above in connection with FIG. **11** may be used to appropriately power the motor **65**.\nFIGS. **32** -**36** illustrate a two-stroke, motorized surgical cutting and fastening instrument **10** with power assist according to another embodiment. The embodiment of FIGS. **32** -**36** is similar to that of FIGS. **25** -**31** except that in the embodiment of FIGS. **32** -**36** , the firing trigger **20** includes a lower portion **228** and an upper portion **230**. Both  portions **228** , **230** are connected to and pivot about a pivot pin **207** that is disposed through each  portion **228** , **230**. The upper portion **230** includes a gear portion **232** that engages the first gear **210** of the gear box assembly **200**. The spring **222** is connected to the upper portion **230** such that the upper portion is biased to rotate in the CW direction. The upper portion **230** may also include a lower arm **234** that contacts an upper surface of the lower portion **228** of the firing trigger **20** such that when the upper portion **230** is caused to rotate CW the lower portion **228** also rotates CW, and when the lower portion **228** rotates CCW the upper portion **230** also rotates CCW. Similarly, the lower portion **228** includes a rotational stop **238** that engages a lower shoulder of the upper portion **230**. In that way, when the upper portion **230** is caused to rotate CCW the lower portion **228** also rotates CCW, and when the lower portion **228** rotates CW the upper portion **230** also rotates CW.\nThe illustrated embodiment also includes the run motor sensor **110** that communicates a signal to the motor **65** that, in various embodiments, may cause the motor **65** to rotate at a speed proportional to the force applied by the operator when retracting the firing trigger **20**. The sensor **110** may be, for example, a rheostat or some other variable resistance sensor, as explained herein. In addition, the instrument **10** may include a reverse motor sensor **130** that is tripped or switched when contacted by a front face **242** of the upper portion **230** of the firing trigger **20**. When activated, the reverse motor sensor **130** sends a signal to the motor **65** to reverse direction. Also, the instrument **10** may include a stop motor sensor **142** that is tripped or actuated when contacted by the lower portion **228** of the firing trigger **20**. When activated, the stop motor sensor **142** sends a signal to stop the reverse rotation of the motor **65**.\nIn operation, when an operator retracts the closure trigger **18** into the locked position, the firing trigger **20** is retracted slightly (through mechanisms known in the art, including U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,978,921 and 6,905,057, which are incorporated herein by reference) so that the user can grasp the firing trigger **20** to initiate the cutting/stapling operation, as shown in FIGS. **32** and **33** . At that point, as shown in FIG. **33** , the gear portion **232** of the upper portion **230** of the firing trigger **20** moves into engagement with the first gear **210** of the gear box assembly **200**. When the operator retracts the firing trigger **20** , according to various embodiments, the firing trigger **20** may rotate a small amount, such as five degrees, before tripping the run motor sensor **110** , as shown in FIG. **34** . Activation of the sensor **110** causes the motor **65** to forward rotate at a rate proportional to the retraction force applied by the operator. The forward rotation of the motor **65** causes, as described above, the main drive shaft **48** to rotate, which causes the knife **32** in the end effector **12** to be deployed (i.e., begin traversing the channel **22**). Rotation of the pinion gear **124** , which is connected to the main drive shaft **48** , causes the gears **210** -**220** in the gear box assembly **200** to rotate. Since the first gear **210** is in engagement with the gear portion **232** of the upper portion **230** of the firing trigger **20** , the upper portion **232** is caused to rotate CCW, which causes the lower portion **228** to also rotate CCW.\nWhen the knife **32** is fully deployed (i.e., at the end of the cutting stroke), the front face **242** of the upper portion **230** trips the reverse motor sensor **130** , which sends a signal to the motor **65** to reverse rotational directional. This causes the main drive shaft assembly to reverse rotational direction to retract the knife **32**. Reverse rotation of the main drive shaft assembly causes the gears **210** -**220** in the gear box assembly to reverse direction, which causes the upper portion **230** of the firing trigger **20** to rotate CW, which causes the lower portion **228** of the firing trigger **20** to rotate CW until the lower portion **228** trips or actuates the stop motor sensor **142** when the knife **32** is fully retracted, which causes the motor **65** to stop. In that way, the user experiences feedback regarding deployment of the end effector **12** by way of the user's grip on the firing trigger **20**. Thus, when the user retracts the firing trigger **20** , the operator will experience a resistance related to the deployment of the end effector **12** and, in particular, to the loading force experienced by the knife **32**. Similarly, when the operator releases the firing trigger **20** after the cutting/stapling operation so that it can return to its original position, the user will experience a CW rotation force from the firing trigger **20** that is generally proportional to the reverse speed of the motor **65**.\nIt should also be noted that in this embodiment the user can apply force (either in lieu of or in addition to the force from the motor **65**) to actuate the main drive shaft assembly (and hence the cutting/stapling operation of the end effector **12**) through retracting the firing trigger **20**. That is, retracting the firing trigger **20** causes the gear portion **232** of the upper portion **230** to rotate CCW, which causes the gears of the gear box assembly **200** to rotate, thereby causing the pinion gear **124** to rotate, which causes the main drive shaft assembly to rotate.\nThe above-described embodiments employed power-assist user feedback systems, with or without adaptive control (e.g., using a  sensor **110** , **130** , and **142** outside of the closed loop system of the motor, gear drive train, and end effector) for a two-stroke, motorized surgical cutting and fastening instrument. That is, force applied by the user in retracting the firing trigger **20** may be added to the force applied by the motor **65** by virtue of the firing trigger **20** being geared into (either directly or indirectly) the gear drive train between the motor **65** and the main drive shaft **48**. In other embodiments of the present invention, the user may be provided with tactile feedback regarding the position of the knife **32** in the end effector, but without having the firing trigger **20** geared into the gear drive train. FIGS. **37** -**40** illustrate a motorized surgical cutting and fastening instrument with such a tactile position feedback system.\nIn the illustrated embodiment of FIGS. **37** -**40** , the firing trigger **20** may have a lower portion **228** and an upper portion **230** , similar to the instrument **10** shown in FIGS. **32** -**36** . Unlike the embodiment of FIGS. **32** -**36** , however, the upper portion **230** does not have a gear portion that mates with part of the gear drive train. Instead, the instrument includes a second motor **265** with a threaded rod **266** threaded therein. The threaded rod **266** reciprocates longitudinally in and out of the motor **265** as the motor **265** rotates, depending on the direction of rotation. The instrument **10** also includes an encoder **268** that is responsive to the rotations of the main drive shaft **48** for translating the incremental angular motion of the main drive shaft **48** (or other component of the main drive assembly) into a corresponding series of digital signals, for example. In the illustrated embodiment, the pinion gear **124** includes a proximate drive shaft **270** that connects to the encoder **268**.\nThe instrument **10** also includes a control circuit (not shown), which may be implemented using a microcontroller or some other type of integrated circuit, that receives the digital signals from the encoder **268**. Based on the signals from the encoder **268** , the control circuit may calculate the stage of deployment of the knife **32** in the end effector **12**. That is, the control circuit can calculate if the knife **32** is fully deployed, fully retracted, or at an intermittent stage. Based on the calculation of the stage of deployment of the end effector **12** , the control circuit may send a signal to the second motor **265** to control its rotation to thereby control the reciprocating movement of the threaded rod **266**.\nIn operation, as shown in FIG. **37** , when the closure trigger **18** is not locked into the clamped position, the firing trigger **20** rotated away from the pistol grip portion **26** of the handle **6** such that the front face **242** of the upper portion **230** of the firing trigger **20** is not in contact with the proximate end of the threaded rod **266**. When the operator retracts the closure trigger **18** and locks it in the clamped position, the firing trigger **20** rotates slightly towards the closure trigger **20** so that the operator can grasp the firing trigger **20** , as shown in FIG. **38** . In this position, the front face **242** of the upper portion **230** contacts the proximate end of the threaded rod **266**.\nAs the user then retracts the firing trigger **20** , after an initial rotational amount (e.g., 5 degrees of rotation) the run motor sensor **110** may be activated such that, as explained above, the sensor **110** sends a signal to the motor **65** to cause it to rotate at a forward speed proportional to the amount of retraction force applied by the operator to the firing trigger **20**. Forward rotation of the motor **65** causes the main drive shaft **48** to rotate via the gear drive train, which causes the knife **32** and sled **33** to travel down the channel **22** and sever tissue clamped in the end effector **12**. The control circuit receives the output signals from the encoder **268** regarding the incremental rotations of the main drive shaft assembly and sends a signal to the second motor **265** to caused the second motor **265** to rotate, which causes the threaded rod **266** to retract into the motor **265**. This allows the upper portion **230** of the firing trigger **20** to rotate CCW, which allows the lower portion **228** of the firing trigger to also rotate CCW. In that way, because the reciprocating movement of the threaded rod **266** is related to the rotations of the main drive shaft assembly, the operator of the instrument **10** , by way of his/her grip on the firing trigger **20** , experiences tactile feedback as to the position of the end effector **12**. The retraction force applied by the operator, however, does not directly affect the drive of the main drive shaft assembly because the firing trigger **20** is not geared into the gear drive train in this embodiment.\nBy virtue of tracking the incremental rotations of the main drive shaft assembly via the output signals from the encoder **268** , the control circuit can calculate when the knife **32** is fully deployed (i.e., fully extended). At this point, the control circuit may send a signal to the motor **65** to reverse direction to cause retraction of the knife **32**. The reverse direction of the motor **65** causes the rotation of the main drive shaft assembly to reverse direction, which is also detected by the encoder **268**. Based on the reverse rotation detected by the encoder **268** , the control circuit sends a signal to the second motor **265** to cause it to reverse rotational direction such that the threaded rod **266** starts to extend longitudinally from the motor **265**. This motion forces the upper portion **230** of the firing trigger **20** to rotate CW, which causes the lower portion **228** to rotate CW. In that way, the operator may experience a CW force from the firing trigger **20** , which provides feedback to the operator as to the retraction position of the knife **32** in the end effector **12**. The control circuit can determine when the knife **32** is fully retracted. At this point, the control circuit may send a signal to the motor **65** to stop rotation.\nAccording to other embodiments, rather than having the control circuit determine the position of the knife **32** , reverse motor and stop motor sensors may be used, as described above. In addition, rather than using a proportional sensor **110** to control the rotation of the motor **65** , an on/off switch or sensor can be used. In such an embodiment, the operator would not be able to control the rate of rotation of the motor **65**. Rather, it would rotate at a preprogrammed rate.\nThe various embodiments of the present invention have been described above in connection with cutting-type surgical instruments. It should be noted, however, that in other embodiments, the inventive surgical instrument disclosed herein need not be a cutting-type surgical instrument. For example, it could be a non-cutting endoscopic instrument, a grasper, a stapler, a clip applier, an access device, a drug/gene therapy delivery device, an energy device using ultrasound, RF, laser, etc.\nFIG. **43** depicts a surgical cutting and fastening instrument **2010** that is capable of practicing various unique benefits of the end effectors and drive arrangements of the present invention. The surgical instrument **2010** depicted in FIG. **43** comprises a handle **2006** , a shaft assembly **2008** , and an articulating end effector **2300** pivotally connected to the shaft assembly **2008** at an articulation pivot **2014**. In various embodiments, the control handle houses a drive motor **2600** and control system generally represented as **2610** therein for controlling the opening and closing of the end effector **2300** and the cutting and stapling of the tissue clamped therein. An articulation control **2016** may be provided adjacent to the handle **2006** to effect rotation of the end effector **2300** about the articulation pivot **2014**. The handle **2006** of the instrument **2010** may include a closure trigger **2018** and a firing trigger **2020** for actuating the end effector **2300**. The end effector **2300** is shown separated from the handle **2006** preferably by an elongate shaft **2008**. In one embodiment, a clinician or operator of the instrument **2010** may articulate the end effector **2300** relative to a proximal portion of the shaft **2008** by utilizing the articulation control **2016** , as described in more detail in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/329,020, filed Jan. 10, 2006, entitled SURGICAL INSTRUMENT HAVING AN ARTICULATING END EFFECTOR, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,670,334. Other articulation arrangements could also be employed.\nAs will be discussed in further detail below, various end effector embodiments include an anvil **2340** , which is maintained at a spacing that assures effective stapling and severing of tissue clamped in the end effector **2300**. In various exemplary embodiments, the handle **2006** may include a pistol grip **2026** towards which a closure trigger **2018** is pivotally drawn by the clinician to cause clamping or closing of the anvil **2340** toward cartridge **2500** seated in an elongate channel **2302** of the end effector **2300** to thereby clamp tissue positioned between the anvil **2340** and the staple cartridge **2500**. A firing trigger **2020** may be situated farther outboard of the closure trigger **2018**. In various embodiments, once the closure trigger **2018** is locked in the closure position as further described below, the firing trigger **2020** may rotate slightly toward the pistol grip **2026** so that it can be reached by the operator using one hand. Then the operator may pivotally draw the firing trigger **2020** toward the pistol grip **2026** to cause the stapling and severing of clamped tissue in the end effector **2300**. Those of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate however, that other handle and drive system arrangements may be successfully employed in connection with various embodiments described herein and their equivalent structures without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.\nIt will be appreciated that the terms âproximalâ and âdistalâ are used herein with reference to a clinician gripping the handle **2006** of an instrument **2010**. Thus, the end effector **2300** is distal with respect to the more proximal handle **2006**. It will be further appreciated that, for convenience and clarity, spatial terms such as âverticalâ and âhorizontalâ are used herein with respect to the drawings. However, surgical instruments are used in many orientations and positions, and these terms are not intended to be limiting and absolute.\nFIGS. **43** -**47** illustrate a unique and novel end effector **2300** of various embodiments of the present invention adapted for use with a staple cartridge **2500** , the basic operation of which is known in the art. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,978,921, entitled SURGICAL STAPLING INSTRUMENT INCORPORATING AN E-BEAM FIRING MECHANISM, provides more details about the construction of such staple cartridges.\nIn general, such staple cartridges **2500** include a cartridge body **2502** that is divided by a central, elongated slot **2508** which extends from the proximal end **2504** of the cartridge body **2502** towards its tapered outer tip **2506**. See FIG. **46** . The cartridge body **2502** may be fabricated from a polymeric material and be attached to a metal cartridge pan **2510**. A plurality of staple-receiving pockets **2512** are formed within the cartridge body **2502** and are arranged in six laterally spaced longitudinal rows or âlinesâ of  staples **2514** , **2516** , **2518** , **2520** , **2522** , **2524**. See FIG. **48** . Positioned within the pockets **2512** are stapleâsupporting drivers **2532** which support staples **2534** thereon. Depending upon the location (line) of staple-receiving pockets **2512** , the staple supporting drivers **2532** may support one or two staples **2530** thereon. The cartridge body **2502** further includes four  longitudinal slots **2503** , **2505** , **2507** , **2509** extending from its proximal end **2504** to its tapered outer tip **2506** for receiving corresponding sled cams **2328** formed on a wedge sled **2326** in the end effector **2300** , the construction and operation of which will discussed in further detail below. See FIG. **47** . As the sled cams **2328** are advanced through their  respective slots **2503** , **2505** , **2507** , **2509** in the cartridge body **2502** from proximal end **2504** to distal end **2506** , they contact the staple-supporting drivers **2532** associated with those slots and force the staple-supporting drivers **2532** and the staples **2534** that they support upward out of the cartridge body **2502**. See FIG. **49** . As the ends of the legs **2536** of the staple**2** **534** contact the pockets **2350** formed in the bottom surface **2341** of the anvil **2340** , they are folded over to close the staples **2534**.\nVarious end effectors of the present invention include an elongate channel **2302** that is sized to removably receive and support the cartridge body **2502** and pan **2510** of a disposable cartridge **2500** therein. A knife screw **2304** is rotatably supported in the elongate channel **2302**. The knife screw **2304** has a distal end **2306** that has a distal thrust bearing **2308** attached thereto that is rotatably supported by a distal bearing housing **2310** formed in the distal end **2303** of the elongate channel **2302**. See FIG. **46** . The knife screw **2304** has a central drive portion **2312** with a helical thread formed thereon. The knife screw **2304** further has a smooth extension portion **2314** and a knife screw gear **2316** formed thereon or otherwise attached thereto. A proximal thrust bearing **2318** is formed or attached to the proximal end **2317** of the knife screw **2304**. The proximal thrust bearing **2318** is rotatably housed within a proximal bearing housing **2319** supported in a distal spine tube segment **2058**. The distal spine tube segment **2058** has a pair of columns **2059** formed on its distal end that are adapted to be received in vertical slots **2307** formed in the proximal end **2305** of the elongate channel **2302**. The columns **2059** may be retained within the slots **2307** in the elongate channel **2302** by friction, adhesive, or by the distal end of the shaft tube **2009**. See FIGS. **43** and **46** .\nVarious embodiments of the present invention further include a knife assembly **2320** that has a knife/sled bearing **2322** that is threaded onto the threaded portion **2312** of the knife screw **2304**. The knife assembly **2320** supports a vertically extending blade **2324** and a wedge sled **2326** that supports the four sled cams **2328**. The reader will understand that, as the knife screw **2304** is rotated in a clockwise direction, the knife assembly **2320** and the wedge sled **2326** is advanced toward the distal end **2303** (direction âAâ) of the elongate channel **2302** and, when the knife screw **2304** is rotated in a counterclockwise direction, the knife assembly **2320** and wedge sled **2326** is moved toward the proximal end **2305** of the channel member **2302** (direction âBâ). In addition, the knife assembly **2320** has a pair of laterally extending deflector tabs **2330** protruding therefrom, the purpose of which will be discussed below.\nIn various embodiments of the present invention, an anvil **2340** is pivotally coupled to the proximal end **2305** of the channel member **2302** by a pair of trunnion tabs **2342** that are sized to be received in oval-shaped pivot holes **2700** provided through the side walls **2309** of the elongate channel **2302**. In various embodiments, the anvil **2340** may be stamped from sheet metal or other material such that the trunnion tabs **2342** are substantially rectangular or square shaped. In other embodiments, the anvil **2340** may be molded or machined from other materials such that it is rigid in nature and the trunnion tabs or pins are substantially round. As can be seen in FIGS. **49** and **73** , the bottom surface **2341** of the anvil **2340** has a series of staple forming pockets **2350** formed therein. It will be understood that the staple forming pockets **2350** serve to close the staples **2534** as the ends of the staple legs **2536** are forced into contact therewith. In addition, a longitudinal clearance slot **2343** may be provided in the bottom surface **2341** of the anvil **2340** for receiving the upper end of the knife assembly **2320** and the guide tabs **2330** therethrough such that the laterally extending guide tabs **2330** serve to urge the anvil **2340** down onto the elongated channel **2302** as the knife assembly **2320** and wedge sled **2326** are driven through the cartridge **2500** to cut the tissue and deploy the staples **2534**.\nA drive assembly for operating various embodiments of the end effector **2300** will now be described. In various embodiments, a distal drive shaft portion **2402** extends through a drive shaft hole **2061** in the distal spine tube **2058**. See FIG. **46** . The distal drive shaft portion **2402** may extend directly to a drive motor arrangement **2600** in the control handle **2006** or it may be articulated to enable the end effector **2300** to be pivoted relative to the shaft or closure tube assembly that connects the end effector **2300** to the control handle **2006**.\nAs can be seen in FIGS. **52** -**55** , in various embodiments of the present invention the distal drive shaft portion **2402** has a clutch-receiving portion **2404** and a closure thread **2406** formed thereon. A clutch assembly **2410** is slidably received on the clutchâreceiving portion **2404** of the drive shaft portion **2402**. In various embodiments, the clutch assembly **2410** includes a collet-like tapered clutch member **2412** that has a drive gear **2414** integrally formed on its proximal end **2413**. See FIGS. **56** and **57** . The drive gear **2414** meshes with a transfer gear **2450** that in turn meshes with the knife screw gear **2316**. See FIGS. **50** and **51** . Thus, when the clutch assembly **2410** drivingly engages the distal drive shaft portion **2402** , the drive gear **2414** rotates the transfer gear **2450** which, in turn rotates the knife screw gear **2316**.\nA series of four tapered sections **2416** are formed on the distal end **2415** of the tapered clutch member **2412**. A series of male splines **2418** are formed in the interior of the tapered sections **2416**. See FIGS. **56** and **57** . The male splines **2418** are adapted to selectively engage a female spline section **2408** formed on the distal drive shaft portion **2402** as will be discussed in further detail below. See FIGS. **52** -**55** . The clutch assembly **2410** further includes a clutch plate **2420** that is received on the tapered sections **2416** of the tapered clutch member **2412**. As can be seen in FIGS. **58** and **59** , the clutch plate **2420** has a proximal hub portion **2422** and a distal hub portion **2424** that is separated by a flange portion **2426**. A cylindrical distal hole portion **2428** extends through the distal hub portion **2424** and a tapered proximal hole **2430** extends through the flange portion **2426** and the proximal hub portion **2422**. The  hole portions **2428** , **2430** enable the clutch plate **2420** to be slidably received on the drive shaft **2402** and slide onto the tapered clutch member **2412**. A clutch opening spring **2432** is provided between a flange portion **2417** formed on the tapered clutch member **2412** and the flange portion **2426** of the clutch plate **2420** and a thrust bearing **2434** is also journaled on the clutch-receiving portion **2404** adjacent to the clutch plate **2420**. See FIGS. **63** and **64** .\nAlso in various embodiments, a closure nut **2440** is received on the distal drive shaft portion **2402**. As can be seen in FIGS. **54** , **55** , **60** and **61** , the closure nut **2440** has a threaded hole portion **2442** extending partially therethrough to enable it to be threaded onto the closure thread **2406** on the distal drive shaft portion **2402**. As can be further seen in those Figures, the closure nut **2440** has an upstanding closure ramp **2444** protruding therefrom. The top of the closure ramp **2444** terminates in a radiused portion **2446** that extends to an upstanding closure tab **2448** that is adapted to engage a downwardly protruding closure hook **2346** formed on the proximal end **2345** of anvil **2340**.\nMore specifically and with reference to FIG. **63** , the proximal end **2345** of the anvil **2340** has an anvil closure arm portion **2347** protruding proximally therefrom that terminates in a downwardly extending closure hook **2346**. As can also be seen in that Figure, the bottom surface of the anvil closure arm **2347** has a tab relief groove **2348** therein for receiving the closure tab **2348** when the closure nut **2440** is advanced to its most distal position (shown in FIGS. **69** -**72** ). Also in various embodiments, a closure lock spring **2460** is attached to the bottom of the elongate channel **2302** , by mechanical fastener arrangements or adhesive. The closure lock spring **2460** has an upper portion **2462** that terminates in an upstanding retainer lip **2464**. In addition, longitudinally extending retainer arm **2466** is rigidly attached to the upper portion **2462** of the closure lock spring **2460**. See FIG. **46** .\nVarious embodiments of the present invention employ an anvil **2340** that is capable of moving axially and laterally relative to the elongate channel **2302** prior to being advanced to the closed position. More specifically and with reference to FIGS. **62** -**72** , in various embodiments, the elongate channel **2302** is stamped or otherwise formed from sheet metal or the like and the pivot holes may be punched therein. Such construction leads to reduced manufacturing costs for the end effector. Other embodiments may be machined from rigid materials such as 2416 stainless steel such that the trunnion pins are substantially round in cross-section. Regardless of which manufacturing method is employed to manufacture the anvil **2340** and the resulting shape of the trunnion tabs **2342** , as can be seen in FIGS. **63** , **66** , **68** , **70** , and **74** , the pivot holes **2700** are oval or oblong and serve to afford the trunnion tabs **2342** with the ability to move axially back and forth and up and down in their corresponding pivot hole **2700**. As can be seen in FIG. **74** , the trunnion tabs **2342** may have a length âXâ of, for example, approximately 0.060 inches and a height âYâ of, for example, approximately 0.050 inches. The pivot holes **2700** have a proximal wall portion **2702** , a distal wall portion **2704** , an upper wall portion **2706** and a lower wall portion **2708**. In various embodiments, for example, the distance âLâ between the proximal wall **2702** and the distal wall **2704** may be approximately 0.120 inches and the distance âHâ between the upper wall portion **2706** and lower wall portion **2708** may be approximately 0.090 inches. See FIG. **74** . Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that these distances and tolerances may, in connection with various embodiments, be somewhat dictated by the manufacturing tolerances attainable by the processes used to manufacture the anvil **2340** and the elongate channel **2302**. In other embodiments, however, the distances âHâ, âLâ, âXâ, and âYâ may be sized relative to each other to enable the anvil **2340** to travel along a closing path that is relatively substantially parallel to the top surface of a cartridge **2500** supported in the elongate channel **2302**. Such arrangement serves to prevent or minimize the likelihood of tissue from being rolled out of between the anvil and the cartridge during clamping. Thus, these dimensions are merely exemplary and are not intended to be limiting. The trunnion tabs **2342** and the pivot holes **2700** may have other sizes, shapes and dimensions relative to each other that differ from such exemplary dimensions given herein that nevertheless enable those components to operate in the unique and novel manner of various embodiments of the present invention as described herein.\nThis ability of the trunnion tabs **2342** to travel within their respective pivot hole **2700** in the side walls of the **2309** of the elongate channel **2302** can be appreciated from reference to FIGS. **62** -**68** . As can be seen in each of those Figures, the closure nut **2440** is in its distal-most open position. When in that position, the retainer lip **2464** of the closure lock spring is biased under the closure nut **2440** and does not restrict the travel thereof. FIGS. **62** and **63** illustrate the trunnion tabs **2342** adjacent the proximal end wall portions **2702** of the pivot holes. FIGS. **65** and **44** illustrate the trunnion tabs **2342** after they have crept somewhat midway between the proximal end wall portion **2702** and the distal end wall portion **2704** of the pivot hole **2700**. FIGS. **67** and **68** illustrate the trunnion tabs **2342** after they have crept to a position adjacent the distal end wall portions **2704** of the pivot holes **2700**. Thus, in various embodiments, the trunnion tabs **2342** are loosely received within their respective pivot holes **2700** and capable of moving axially, laterally and vertically or in combinations of such directions therein.\nFIGS. **69** -**72** illustrate the anvil **2340** in a closed position. As can be seen in FIG. **70** , the trunnion tabs **2342** are in abutting contact with a proximal end wall portion **2702** of the pivot hole **2700**. When in that position (i.e., when the trunnion tabs **2342** are held in abutting contact with proximal end wall portion **2702**), the staple-forming pockets **2350** in the bottom surface **2341** of the anvil **2340** are in axial registration with corresponding staple-receiving pockets **2512** in the cartridge **2500** seated in the elongate channel **2302** such that when the staples **2534** are fired, they are correctly formed by the corresponding pockets **2350** in the anvil **2340**. The anvil **2340** is locked in that position by the retainer lip **2464** portion of the closure lock spring **2460** as will be discussed in further detail below.\nAlso in various embodiments, the anvil **2340** is capable of moving laterally relative to the elongate channel due to manufacturing tolerances in the fabrication of the trunnion tabs **2342** and the pivot holes **2700**. As can be seen in FIGS. **44** -**46** , **62** , **65** , **69** , and **73** , in various embodiments, the anvil **2340** is provided with a pair of downwardly extending tissue stops **2344**. During the clamping process, the tissue stops **2344** essentially perform two functions. One of the functions consists of orienting the tissue **2900** within the end effector **2300** so as to prevent the tissue **2900** from extending axially into the end effector **2300** such that it extends beyond the innermost staple pockets **2512** in the cartridge **2500** when seated in the elongate channel **2302**. See FIG. **65** . This prevents tissue **2900** from being cut that is not stapled. The other function performed by the tissue stops **2344** is to axially align the anvil **2340** relative to the elongate channel **2302** and ultimately to the cartridge **2500** received therein. As the anvil **2340** is closed, the tissue stops **2344** serve to contact corresponding alignment surfaces **2720** on the side of the elongate channel **2302** and serve to laterally align the anvil **2340** relative to the elongate channel **2302** when the anvil **2340** is closed and clamping tissue **2900** such that the staple-forming pockets **2350** in the bottom surface **2341** of the anvil **2340** are laterally aligned with the corresponding staple-receiving pockets **2512** in the cartridge **2500**. See FIGS. **69** and **73** .\nThe operation of various embodiments of the present invention will now be described with reference to FIGS. **62** -**71** . FIGS. **62** -**68** illustrate the closure nut **2440** in an open position. As can be seen in those Figures, when in the open position, the closure nut **2440** is located such that the hook arm **2346** is permitted to move to various positions relative thereto that enable the anvil **2340** to pivot open to permit tissue **2900** to be inserted between the anvil **2340** and the elongated channel **2302** and cartridge **2500** seated therein. When in this position, the distal end **2467** of the retainer arm **2466** that is attached to the closure lock spring **2460** is in contact with a ramp surface **2321** formed on the proximal end of the knife assembly **2320**. See FIG. **64** . As the knife assembly **2320** moves proximally, the end of the retainer arm **2466** contacts the ramp surface **2321** on the proximal end of the knife assembly **2320** and serves to cause the retainer arm **2466** to bias the upper portion **2462** of the closure lock spring **2460** downward toward the bottom of the elongate channel **2302**. When the knife assembly **2320** moves distally away from the retainer arm **2466** , the upper portion **2462** of the closure lock spring **2460** is permitted to spring upward to enable the retainer lip **2464** to engage the closure nut **2440** as will be further discussed below.\nThe reader will appreciate that when the end effector **2300** is in the open positions depicted in FIGS. **62** -**68** , the user can install a disposable cartridge assembly **2500** in the elongate member **2302**. Also, when in those positions, the anvil **2340** may be able to move axially, laterally and vertically relative to the elongate channel **2302**. In various embodiments, when the drive shaft **2402** is rotated in a first direction, the closure thread **2406** thereon threadably drives the closure nut **2440** in the proximal direction (direction âBâ in FIG. **50** ) until the closure threads **2406** disengage the threaded hole **2442** in the closure nut **2440**. See FIG. **55** . As the closure nut **2440** is driven proximally, the closure hook **2346** on the anvil closure arm **2347** rides up the ramp **2444** of the closure nut **2440** until it rides into the radiused portion **2446** and contacts the closure tab **2448**. Such movement of the closure nut **2440** serves to âpullâ the anvil **2340** to the closed position. See FIGS. **69** -**71** . When in that position, the trunnion tabs **2342** are in abutting contact with the proximal end portion **2702** of the pivot holes **2700** and the retainer lip **2464** of the closure lock spring has engaged the distal end **2441** of the closure nut **2440** to retain the anvil **2340** in the fully closed and axially aligned position. When also in that position, by virtue of the contact of the tissue stops **2344** with the alignment surfaces **2720** on the side walls **2309** of the elongate channel **2302** , the anvil **2340** is laterally aligned with the elongate channel **2302** so that the staple forming pockets **2350** in the anvil **2340** are laterally aligned with corresponding the staple-receiving pockets **2512** in the cartridge **2500**.\nAs the closure nut **2440** is driven in the proximal direction, the proximal end **2449** of the closure nut **2440** contacts the thrust bearing **2434** which forces the clutch plate **2420** in the proximal direction against the force of clutch opening spring **2432**. Further travel of the closure nut **2440** in the proximal direction drives the clutch plate **2420** onto the tapered sections **2416** of the tapered clutch member **2412** which causes the male splines **2418** therein to engage the female splines **2408** on the distal drive shaft portion **2402**. Such engagement of the male splines **2418** in the tapered clutch member **2412** with the female splines on the distal drive shaft portion **2402** causes the tapered clutch member **2412** and the drive gear **2414** to rotate with the distal drive shaft portion **2402**. Drive gear **2414** , in turn, rotates the knife screw gear **2316** which causes the knife screw to rotate and drive the knife assembly distally (âAâ direction).\nAs the knife assembly **2320** is driven distally, it cuts the tissue and the cams **2328** on the wedge sled **2326** serve to drive the staple supporting drivers **2532** upward which drive the staples **2534** toward the anvil **2340**. As the legs **2536** of the staples **2534** are driven into the corresponding staple-forming pockets **2350** in the anvil **2340** , they are folded over. See FIG. **49** .\nWhen the knife assembly **2320** moves distally, the distal end **2467** of the retainer arm **2466** is no longer in contact with the ramp surface **2321** of the knife assembly **2320** which enables the retainer arm **2466** and the upper portion **2462** of the closure lock spring **2460** to spring upwardly which further enables the retainer lip **2464** on the closure lock spring **2460** to retainingly engage the distal end **2441** of the closure nut **2440** to prevent it from moving distally. See FIGS. **70** and **71** . By virtue of its contact with the closure nut **2440** which is in contact with the thrust bearing **2434** , the retainer lip **2464** serves to retain the clutch assembly **2410** engaged with the distal drive shaft portion **2402** until the knife assembly **2320** once again returns to contact the distal end **2467** of the retainer arm **2464**. After the knife assembly **2320** has been driven to its final distal position as shown in FIG. **72** , it activates a conventional sensor or contact **2313** mounted within the elongate channel **2302** and signals the control motor to stop driving the drive shaft **2402**. See FIG. **76** . Those of ordinary skill in the art will understand that a variety of different control arrangements could be employed to control the drive shaft **2402**. For example, when the knife assembly **2310** reaches its distal-most position and activates the sensor **2313** , the control system **2610** housed within the handle **2006** could automatically reverse the drive motor **2600** therein and cause the drive shaft portion **2402** and knife screw to reverse direction (e.g., move in the proximal âBâ direction). In various other embodiments, the control system **2610** may simply stop the drive motor **2600** and then require the surgeon to activate a button **2030** to cause the motor **2600** to reverse. In still other arrangements, the control system **2610** may institute a predetermined timed delay between the time that the reversing sensor **2313** is activated and the time that the motor **2600** is reversed.\nAs the knife assembly **2320** moves in the proximal direction on the knife screw **2304** , the closure threads **2406** on the drive shaft **2402** begin to screw back into the threaded hole portion **2442** in the closure nut **2440**. During this process, the ramp surface **2321** of the knife assembly **2320** again contacts the distal end **2467** of the retainer arm **2466** which serves to bias the upper portion **2462** of the closure lock spring **2460** toward the bottom of the elongate channel **2302** to permit the retainer lip **2464** to disengage from the distal end **2441** of the closure nut **2440** thereby permitting the clutch opening spring **2432** to bias the clutch assembly **2410** and closure nut **2440** distally. As the closure nut **2440** moves distally, the closure hook **2346** on the anvil **2340** rides up the ramp **2444** on the closure nut **2440** until the closure nut **2440** reaches the open position wherein the closure tab **2448** is received within the tab relief groove **2348** in the bottom surface **2341** of the anvil **2340** and the closure nut **2440** moves the anvil assembly **2372** to the open position. A second conventional sensor or contact **2315** is mounted within the proximal end portion **2305** of the elongate channel **2302** for sensing when the closure nut **2440** is in the open position and communicates with the motor to cause it to stop. See FIG. **46** .\nAs indicated above, a variety of different motor/control arrangements may be employed to power the drive shaft portion **2402**. For example, in various embodiments when the closure trigger **2018** is actuated, that is, drawn in by a user of the instrument **2010** , the motor **2600** may commence the above described closing process. A third sensor **2315** â² may be used in the elongate channel member **2302** to sense when the closure nut **2404** has moved into the closed position (shown in FIG. **70** ). When the third sensor **2315** â² senses that the closure nut **2440** is in that position, the sensor **2315** â² may cause the motor **2600** to stop rotating. Thereafter, if the surgeon is satisfied with the clamping of the tissue in the end effector **2300** , the surgeon may actuate the firing trigger **2020** or other actuator arrangement to activate the motor **2600** to rotate the drive shaft **2402** which drives the knife screw **2304** in the above-mentioned manner.\nAnother drive arrangement is depicted in FIGS. **75** -**77** . In this embodiment, a closure wedge **2440** â² is axially moved by a manual drive assembly **2800**. More specifically and with reference to FIG. **75** , the proximal end **2802** of the drive shaft **2402** â² is has a drive gear **2810** attached thereto. Although a variety of different gear and motor arrangements may be employed, the drive gear **2810** may be oriented for selective meshing engagement with a gear train or transmission assembly generally designated as **2820** that is ultimately driven my motor **2600**. The drive shaft **2402** â² is movably supported by a proximal spine tube segment **2820** that is pivotally coupled to the distal spine tube segment **2058** as described in various of the U.S. patent applications incorporated by reference herein above and rigidly attached to the housing portions **2007** of the handle **2006**. In other arrangements wherein the end-effector is not capable of articulating travel, the distal spine tube **2058** may be longer and rigidly coupled to the sections **2007** of the handle **2006**. Regardless of which spine tube arrangement is employed, the drive shaft **2402** â² is axially and rotatably received therein such that the drive shaft **2402** â² can move axially in the distal and proximal directions and also rotate when engaged with the motor **2600**.\nVarious methods may be employed to mechanically move the drive shaft **2402** â² in the distal and proximal directions. For example, as shown in FIG. **75** , a thrust bearing assembly **2830** may be attached to the drive shaft **2402** â² for selective contact by a control linkage assembly **2840**. As can be seen in that Figure, the control linkage assembly **2840** may be linked to the closure trigger **2018** and capable of biasing the drive shaft **2402** â² in the proximal (âBâ) direction when the closure **2018** is pivoted in the proximal direction, the control linkage assembly contacts the thrust bearing and pulls the drive shaft **2402** in the proximal direction.\nTurning next to FIGS. **76** and **77** , as can be seen in these Figures, the distal end **2406** â² of the drive shaft is rotatably supported within a closure wedge **2440** â² that is similar in construction as closure nut **2440** as described above. In particular, the closure wedge **2440** â² has a proximal hole **2442** â² and a distal hole portion **2443** â² that is larger in diameter than the proximal hole portion **2442** â². The distal end **2406** â² of the drive shaft **2402** â² is rotatably supported in the distal hole portion **2443** â² _by_ a bearing **2445** â². The distal end portion **2406** â² of the drive shaft **2406** â² is longer than the hole **2403** â² such that as the drive shaft **2402** â² moves distally and proximally, it cannot become disengaged from the wedge **2440** â². The wedge **2440** â² also has a closure ramp portion **2444** â², a radiused portion **2446** â², and a closure tab **2448** â² formed thereon. As can be seen in FIGS. **76** and **77** , a drive gear **2414** â² is attached to the drive shaft **2402** â² and is adapted to mesh with the transfer gear **2450** that is in meshing engagement with the knife screw gear **2316**.\nIn these embodiments, when the user wishes to close the anvil **2340** , the user moves the closure trigger **2018** toward the handle **2006**. This action causes the control linkage assembly **2840** to move the drive shaft **2402** â² in the proximal direction and pull the wedge **2440** â² proximally. As the wedge **2440** â² moves proximally, the closure hook **2346** on the proximal end **2345** of the anvil **2340** rides up the ramp portion **2444** â² thereon until the it is seated in the radiused portion **2446** â² of the wedge **2440** â². The wedge **2440** â² gets biased proximally until the retainer lip **2464** engages the distal end **2441** â² of the wedge **2440** â² as shown in FIG. **77** . When in that position, the trunnion tabs **2342** of the anvil **2340** are in engagement with the proximal end portion **2702** of pivot holes **2700** as described above. Also when in that position, the drive gear **2414** â² is now in meshing engagement with the transfer gear **2450** (not shown in FIG. **77** ) that is in meshing engagement with the knife screw gear **2316**. Thus, when the drive shaft **2402** â² is rotated by activating the control motor, the drive gear **2414** â² serves to drive the transfer gear **2450** and the knife screw gear **2316** to drive the knife assembly **2320** in the above described manner. The closure lock spring **2460** and the motor control sensors in the elongate channel operate in the above described manner.\nAfter the drive motor **2600** has reversed the rotation of the drive shaft **2402** â² which drives the knife assembly **2320** proximally back to its starting position wherein the ramp surface **2321** contacts the distal end **2467** of the retainer arm **2466** , the lip **2464** of the closure lock spring **2460** is biased downwardly to permit the wedge **2440** â² to move distally. The user can then release the closure trigger **2018** which is spring biased to the unactuated position shown in FIG. **43** . As the closure trigger **2018** returns to the unactuated position, the control linkage assembly **2840** permits the drive shaft **2402** â² and wedge **2440** â² to move distally and open the anvil **2340** in the above-described manner.\nThe reader will understand that various embodiments of the present invention provide vast improvements over prior end effectors and end effector drive arrangements. In particular, the various unique and novel drive system of various embodiments of the present invention permit the anvil and elongated channel components of the end effector to be manufactured utilizing materials and processes that are more economical than other materials and processes used in the past without sacrificing performance. In addition, by providing an anvil that can travel along a closing path that is substantially parallel to the elongate channel and staple cartridge housed therein, reduces the likelihood that the tissue will be rolled out of position during the initial closing of the anvil.\nThe invention which is intended to be protected is not to be construed as limited to the particular embodiments disclosed. The embodiments are therefore to be regarded as illustrative rather than restrictive. Variations and changes may be made by others without departing from the spirit of the present invention. Accordingly, it is expressly intended that all such equivalents, variations and changes which fall within the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined in the claims be embraced thereby.\nAlthough the present invention has been described herein in connection with certain disclosed embodiments, many modifications and variations to those embodiments may be implemented. For example, different types of end effectors may be employed. Also, where materials are disclosed for certain components, other materials may be used. The foregoing description and following claims are intended to cover all such modification and variations.\nAny patent, publication, or other disclosure material, in whole or in part, that is said to be incorporated by reference herein is incorporated herein only to the extent that the incorporated materials does not conflict with existing definitions, statements, or other disclosure material set forth in this disclosure.
