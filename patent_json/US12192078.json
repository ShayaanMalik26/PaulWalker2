  "patent_title": "System and method of assigning reputation scores to hosts",
  "abstract": "Abstract\n\nA method provides for receiving network traffic from a host having a host IP address and operating in a data center, and analyzing a malware tracker for IP addresses of hosts having been infected by a malware to yield an analysis. When the analysis indicates that the host IP address has been used to communicate with an external host infected by the malware to yield an indication, the method includes assigning a reputation score, based on the indication, to the host. The method can further include applying a conditional policy associated with using the host based on the reputation score. The reputation score can include a reduced reputation score from a previous reputation score for the host.",

of hosts having been infected by malware and assigning a reputation score to a host based on whether the host IP address has been used to communicate with an external host infected by the malware.\n* Network architectures for observing and capturing information about network traffic in a datacenter are described herein.\n* Network traffic from a compute environment (whether from a container, VM, hardware switch, hypervisor or physical server) is captured by entities called sensors or capture agents that can be deployed in or inside different environments.\n* Sensors export data or metadata of the observed network activity to collection agents called âcollectors.â\n* Collectors can be a group of processes running on a single machine or a cluster of machines. For the sake of simplicity, collectors can be treated as one logical entity and referred to as one collector. In actual deployment on the datacenter scale, there will be more than just one collector, each responsible for handling export data from a group of sensors. Collectors are capable of doing preprocessing and analysis of the data collected from sensors.\n* the collector is capable of sending the processed or unprocessed data to a cluster of processes responsible for analysis of network data.\n* the entities which receive the data from the collector can be a cluster of processes, and this logical group can be considered or referred to as a âpipeline.â\n* sensors and collectors are not limited to observing and processing just network data, but can also capture other system information like currently active processes, active file handles, socket handles, status of I/O devices, memory, etc.\n* a host in a datacenter may at some point interact through a packet flow with a malware infected host or become infected itself.\n* the infection can be very damaging to data, hardware, software and/or privacy. What is needed is an improved ability to determine whether a host has been infected with malware.\n* FIG. 1 illustrates a diagram of an example network environment\n* FIG. 2 A illustrates a schematic diagram of an example capturing agent deployment in a virtualized environment\n* FIG. 2 B illustrates a schematic diagram of an example capturing agent deployment in an example network device\n* FIG. 2 C illustrates a schematic diagram of an example reporting system in an example capturing agent topology\n* FIG. 3 illustrates a schematic diagram of an example configuration for collecting capturing agent reports\n* FIG. 4 illustrates an example method embodiment\n* FIG. 5 illustrates a listing of example fields on a capturing agent report\n* FIG. 6 illustrates an example network device\n* FIGS. 7 A and 7 B illustrate example system embodiments.\n* the method includes assigning a reputation score, based on the indication, to the host.\n* the method can further include applying a conditional policy associated with using the host based on the reputation score.\n* the reputation score can include a reduced reputation score from a previous reputation score for the host. Reputation scores can go up or down based on continued negative or positive activity or a period of negative or positive activity.\n* the method can include analyzing an effectiveness of a policy related to communications with the host based on the reputation score.\n* the method can also include separating malicious and non-malicious behavior based on the indication. Analyzing the malware tracker can mean crawling multiple malware trackers. Finally, assigning the reputation score is further based on data associated with the host and received from a whois database.\n* the disclosed technology addresses the need in the art for identifying malicious processes within a network.\n* a description of an example network environment, as illustrated in FIG. 1 is first disclosed herein.\n* a discussion of capturing agents will then follow.\n* the disclosure continues with a discussion of the specific process for determining whether a host is infected or may become infected with malware.\n* the discussion then concludes with a description of example systems and devices.\n* the system disclosed herein introduces the concept of âreputationâ or a âvulnerability indexâ for a host in a datacenter or any compute environment.\n* the reputation score or vulnerability index can be helpful for a variety of use cases, such as enabling conditional policies based on reputation/vulnerability, separating malicious versus non-malicious behavior, and determining effectiveness of policies, targeting and implementing policies for specific application or service endpoint groups (EPGs) in a software-defined network (SDN), among other examples.\n* EPGs application or service endpoint groups\n* SDN software-defined network\n* a host can have a âGood,â âOK.â or âBadâ reputation, although there can be more or fewer classifications in other embodiments.\n* thresholds for the classifications can be configured by the user based on, for example, preferences, service level agreements (SLAs), sensitivity of services provided by the associated applications, privacy or security expectations or requirements, etc.\n* SLAs service level agreements\n* a host may be designated as âGoodâ if it has a reputation between 0.7 and 1 (assuming a reputation scale of â 1 to 1), âOKâ if it has a reputation less than 0.7 but greater than 0, and âBadâ if it has a negative reputation.\n* the reputation score can be calculated exclusively from analysis of network traffic or activity in a data center.\n* the network data can be obtained through the sensor/collector system and at one or more layers within the network (e.g., underlay and overlay; a physical layer and one or more virtual layers such as a container layer, a hypervisor layer, a virtual machine layer, etc.).\n* layers within the network e.g., underlay and overlay; a physical layer and one or more virtual layers such as a container layer, a hypervisor layer, a virtual machine layer, etc.\n* the reputation of a host in a data center can be reduced if that host has communicated with an external host that has been infected by malware.\n* the system can also crawl whois to determine what IP addresses have been properly allocated to legitimate entities. If a host in a data center is communicating with an unallocated IP address, the system can reduce the reputation of that host. Reputations or vulnerabilities can be quantified for hosts in a data center.\n* Reputation scores or vulnerability indexes can be derived from external sources, such as malware trackers or whois and optionally can utilize that data with the travel data.\n* Reputation scores can also be identified, established and/or tracked using capture agents positioned within the various layers of a network as disclosed herein.\n* the selection of reputation scores and tracking of reputations for devices can be based on capture agents configured in a device hardware layer 104 A , a hypervisor layer 108 A , and/or a virtual machine layer 110 A .\n* the reputation of a host can also be reduced if that host has communicated with an entity in a certain âhigh riskâ geographic location (e.g., countries or jurisdictions having higher statistical numbers of originating hacking events, etc.).\n* FIG. 1 illustrates a diagram of example network environment 100 .\n* Fabric 112 can represent the underlay (i.e., physical network) of network environment 100 .\n* Fabric 112 can include spine routers 1 -N ( 102 A-N ) (collectively â 102 â) and leaf routers 1 -N ( 104 A-N ) (collectively â 104 â).\n* Leaf routers 104 can reside at the edge of fabric 112 , and can thus represent the physical network edges.\n* Leaf routers 104 can be, for example, top-of-rack (âToRâ) switches, aggregation switches, gateways, ingress and/or egress switches, provider edge devices, and/or any other type of routing or switching device.\n* ToR top-of-rack\n* Leaf routers 104 can be responsible for routing and/or bridging tenant or endpoint packets and applying network policies.\n* Spine routers 102 can perform switching and routing within fabric 112 .\n* network connectivity in fabric 112 can flow from spine routers 102 to leaf routers 104 , and vice versa.\n* Leaf routers 104 can provide servers 1 - 4 ( 106 A-D ) (collectively â 106 â), hypervisors 1 - 3 ( 108 A - 108 C ) (collectively â 108 â), virtual machines (VMs) 1 - 4 ( 110 A - 110 D ) (collectively â 110 â), collectors 118 , engines 120 , and the Layer 2 (L2) network access to fabric 112 .\n* Leaf routers 104 can encapsulate and decapsulate packets to and from servers 106 in order to enable communications throughout environment 100 .\n* Leaf routers 104 can also connect other network-capable device(s) or network(s), such as a firewall, a database, a server, etc., to the fabric 112 .\n* Leaf routers 104 can also provide any other servers, resources, endpoints, external networks, VMs, services, tenants, or workloads with access to fabric 112 .\n* VMs 110 can be virtual machines hosted by hypervisors 108 running on servers 106 .\n* VMs 110 can include workloads running on a guest operating system on a respective server.\n* Hypervisors 108 can provide a layer of software, firmware, and/or hardware that creates and runs the VMs 110 .\n* Hypervisors 108 can allow VMs 110 to share hardware resources on servers 106 , and the hardware resources on servers 106 to appear as multiple, separate hardware platforms.\n* hypervisors 108 and servers 106 can host one or more VMs 110 .\n* server 106 A and hypervisor 108 A can host VMs 110 A-B .\n* VMs 110 and/or hypervisors 108 can be migrated to other servers 106 .\n* VM 110 A can be migrated to server 106 C and hypervisor 108 B .\n* Servers 106 can similarly be migrated to other locations in network environment 100 .\n* a server connected to a specific leaf router can be changed to connect to a different or additional leaf router.\n* some or all of servers 106 , hypervisors 108 , and/or VMs 110 can represent tenant space.\n* Tenant space can include workloads, services, applications, devices, and/or resources that are associated with one or more clients or subscribers. Accordingly, traffic in network environment 100 can be routed based on specific tenant policies, spaces, agreements, configurations, etc.\n* addressing can vary between one or more tenants.\n* tenant spaces can be divided into logical segments and/or networks and separated from logical segments and/or networks associated with other tenants.\n* the various servers 106 A, 106 B, 106 C and 106 D shall be used to discuss the concepts related to detecting whether a host or server has been infected with malware. This can be accomplished by studying network data and/or analyzing a malware tracker or malware trackers.\n* leaf routers 104 , servers 106 , hypervisors 108 , and VMs 110 can include capturing agent 116 (also referred to as a âsensorâ or a âcapturing agentâ) configured to capture network data, and report any portion of the captured data to collector 118 .\n* Capturing agents 116 can be processes, agents, modules, drivers, or components deployed on a respective system or system layer (e.g., a server, VM, virtual container, hypervisor, leaf router, bare metal switch, etc.), configured to capture network data for the respective system (e.g., data received or transmitted by the respective system), and report some or all of the captured data and statistics to collector 118\n* a VM capturing agent can run as a process, kernel module, software element, or kernel driver on the guest operating system installed in a VM and configured to capture and report data (e.g., network and/or system data) processed (e.g., sent, received, generated, etc.) by the VM.\n* data e.g., network and/or system data\n* process e.g., sent, received, generated, etc.\n* a hypervisor capturing agent can run as a process, kernel module, software element, or kernel driver on the host operating system installed at the hypervisor layer and configured to capture and report data (e.g., network and/or system data) processed (e.g., sent, received, generated, etc.) by the hypervisor.\n* data e.g., network and/or system data\n* process e.g., sent, received, generated, etc.\n* a container capturing agent can run as a process, kernel module, software element, or kernel driver on the operating system of a device, such as a switch or server, which can be configured to capture and report data processed by the container.\n* a server capturing agent can run as a process, kernel module, software element, or kernel driver on the host operating system of a server and configured to capture and report data (e.g., network and/or system data) processed (e.g., sent, received, generated, etc.) by the server.\n* data e.g., network and/or system data\n* process e.g., sent, received, generated, etc.\n* a network device capturing agent can run as a process, software element, or component in a network device, such as leaf routers 104 , and configured to capture and report data (e.g., network and/or system data) processed (e.g., sent, received, generated, etc.) by the network device.\n* data e.g., network and/or system data\n* process e.g., sent, received, generated, etc.\n* Capturing agents 116 can be configured to report observed data, statistics, and/or metadata about one or more packets, flows, communications, processes, events, and/or activities to collector 118 .\n* capturing agents 116 can capture network data and statistics processed (e.g., sent, received, generated, dropped, forwarded, etc.) by the system or host (e.g., server, hypervisor, VM, container, switch, etc.) of the capturing agents 116 (e.g., where the capturing agents 116 are deployed).\n* the capturing agents 116 can also report the network data and statistics to one or more devices, such as collectors 118 and/or engines 120 .\n* the capturing agents 116 can report an amount of traffic processed by their host, a frequency of the traffic processed by their host, a type of traffic processed (e.g., sent, received, generated, etc.) by their host, a source or destination of the traffic processed by their host, a pattern in the traffic, an amount of traffic dropped or blocked by their host, types of requests or data in the traffic received, discrepancies in traffic (e.g., spoofed addresses, invalid addresses, hidden sender, etc.), protocols used in communications, type or characteristics of responses to traffic by the hosts of the capturing agents 116 , what processes have triggered specific packets, etc.\n* a type of traffic processed e.g., sent, received, generated, etc.\n* a source or destination of the traffic processed by their host e.g., a source or destination of the traffic processed by their host\n* a pattern in the traffic e.g., an amount of traffic dropped or blocked by their host\n* types of requests or data in the traffic received e.g., s\n* Capturing agents 116 can also capture and report information about the system or host of the capturing agents 116 (e.g., type of host, type of environment, status of host, conditions of the host, etc.).

For example, reported data from a subset of capturing agents 116 deployed throughout devices or elements in a tenant space can provide information about the performance, use, quality, events, processes, security status, characteristics, statistics, patterns, conditions, configurations, topology, and/or any other information for the particular tenant space.\n* Collectors 118 can be one or more devices, modules, workloads, VMs, containers, and/or processes capable of receiving data from capturing agents 116 . Collectors 118 can thus collect reports and data from capturing agents 116 . Collectors 118 can be deployed anywhere in network environment 100 and/or even on remote networks capable of communicating with network environment 100 . For example, one or more collectors can be deployed within fabric 112 , on the L2 network, or on one or more of the servers 106 , VMs 110 , hypervisors. Collectors 118 can be hosted on a server or a cluster of seers, for example. In some cases, collectors 118 can be implemented in one or more servers in a distributed fashion.\n* collectors 118 can include one or more collectors. Moreover, a collector can be configured to receive reported data from all capturing agents 116 or a subset of capturing agents 116 . For example, a collector can be assigned to a subset of capturing agents 116 so the data received by that specific collector is limited to data from the subset of capturing agents 116 . Collectors 118 can be configured to aggregate data from all capturing agents 116 and/or a subset of capturing agents 116 . Further, collectors 118 can be configured to analyze some or all of the data reported by capturing agents 116 .\n* Environment 100 can include one or more analytics engines 120 configured to analyze the data reported to collectors 118 .\n* engines 120 can be configured to receive collected data from collectors 118 , aggregate the data, analyze the data (individually and/or aggregated), generate reports, identify conditions, compute statistics, visualize reported data, troubleshoot conditions, visualize the network and/or portions of the network (e.g., a tenant space), generate alerts, identify patterns, calculate misconfigurations, identify errors, generate suggestions, generate testing, detect compromised elements (e.g., capturing agents 116 , devices, servers, switches, etc.), and/or perform any other analytics functions.\n* compromised elements e.g., capturing agents 116 , devices, servers, switches, etc.\n* Engines 120 can include one or more modules or software programs for performing such analytics. Further, engines 120 can reside on one or more servers, devices, VMs, nodes, etc. For example, engines 120 can be separate VMs or servers, an individual VM or server, or a cluster of servers or applications. Engines 120 can reside within the fabric 112 , within the L2 network, outside of the environment 100 (e.g., WAN 114 ), in one or more segments or networks coupled with the fabric 112 (e.g., overlay network coupled with the fabric 112 ), etc. Engines 120 can be coupled with the fabric 112 via the leaf switches 104 , for example.\n* collectors 118 and engines 120 are shown as separate entities, this is simply a non-limiting example for illustration purposes, as other configurations are also contemplated herein.\n* any of collectors 118 and engines 120 can be part of a same or separate entity.\n* any of the collector, aggregation, and analytics functions can be implemented by one entity (e.g., a collector 118 or engine 120 ) or separately implemented by multiple entities (e.g., engines 120 and/or collectors 118 ).\n* Each of the capturing agents 116 can use a respective address (e.g., internet protocol (IP) address, port number, etc.) of their host to send information to collectors 118 and/or any other destination.\n* Collectors 118 may also be associated with their respective addresses such as IP addresses.\n* capturing agents 116 can periodically send information about flows they observe to collectors 118 .\n* Capturing agents 116 can be configured to report each and every flow they observe or a subset of flows they observe. For example, capturing agents 116 can report every flow always, every flow within a period of time, every flow at one or more intervals, or a subset of flows during a period of time or at one or more intervals.\n* Capturing agents 116 can report a list of flows that were active during a period of time (e.g., between the current time and the time of the last report).\n* the consecutive periods of time of observance can be represented as pre-defined or adjustable time series.\n* the series can be adjusted to a specific level of granularity.\n* the time periods can be adjusted to control the level of details in statistics and can be customized based on specific requirements or conditions, such as security, scalability, bandwidth, storage, etc.\n* the time series information can also be implemented to focus on more important flows or components (e.g., VMs) by varying the time intervals.\n* the communication channel between a capturing agent and collector 118 can also create a flow in every reporting interval.\n* the information transmitted or reported by capturing agents 116 can also include information about the flow created by the communication channel.\n* the host can refer to the physical device or component hosting the capturing agent (e.g., server, networking device, ASIC, etc.), the virtualized environment hosting the capturing agent (e.g., hypervisor, virtual machine, etc.), the operating system hosting the capturing agent (e.g., guest operating system, host operating system, etc.), and/or system layer hosting the capturing agent (e.g., hardware layer, operating system layer, hypervisor layer, virtual machine layer, etc.).\n* the physical device or component hosting the capturing agent e.g., server, networking device, ASIC, etc.\n* the virtualized environment

more network addresses, such as an internet protocol (IP) address, to communicate with other devices, components, or networks.\n* IP internet protocol\n* hypervisor 108 A can have a dedicated IP address which it can use to communicate with VMs 110 , server 106 A , and/or any remote devices or networks.\n* Hypervisor 108 A can be assigned a network address, such as an IP, with a global

When reporting a flow via a control flow.\n* VM capturing agents 202 can include a capturing agent identifier that identifies capturing agents 202 as reporting the associated flow.\n* VM capturing agents 202 can also include in the control flow a flow identifier, an IP address, a timestamp, metadata, a process ID, an OS username associated with the process ID, a host or environment descriptor (e.g., type of software bridge or virtual network card, type of host such as a hypervisor or VM, etc.), and any other information, as further described below.\n* capturing agents 202 can append the process and user information (i.e., which process and/or user is associated with a particular flow) to the control flow.\n* the additional information as identified above can be applied to the control flow as labels. Alternatively, the additional information can be included as part of a header, a trailer, or a payload.\n* VM capturing agents 202 can also report multiple flows as a set of flows. When reporting a set of flows, VM capturing agents 202 can include a flow identifier for the set of flows and/or a flow identifier for each flow in the set of flows.

Hypervisor capturing agent 206 can also include one or more timestamps and other information as previously explained, such as process and user information.\n* hypervisor capturing agent 206 can observe and capture any flows or packets reported by VM capturing agents 202 , including any control flows. Accordingly, hypervisor capturing agent 206 can also report any packets or flows reported by V M capturing agents 202 and any control flows generated by VM capturing agents 202 . For example, VM capturing agent 202 A on VM 1 ( 110 A ) captures flow 1 (âF 1 â) and reports F 1 to collector 118 on FIG. 1 .\n* Hypervisor capturing agent 206 on hypervisor 108 A can also see and capture F 1 , as F 1 would traverse hypervisor 108 A when being sent or received by VM 1 ( 110 A ). Accordingly, hypervisor capturing agent 206 on hypervisor 108 A can also report F 1 to collector 118 . Thus, collector 118 can receive a report of F 1 from VM capturing agent 202 A on VM 1 ( 110 A ) and another report of F 1 from hypervisor capturing agent 206 on hypervisor 108 A .\n* hypervisor capturing agent 206 can report F 1 as a message or report that is separate from the message or report of F 1 transmitted by VM capturing agent 202 A on VM 1 ( 110 A ).

However, this is for explanation purposes.\n* the network device can be any other network device, such as any other switch, router, etc.\n* leaf router 104 A can include network resources 222 , such as memory, storage, communication, processing, input, output, and other types of resources.\n* Leaf router 104 A can also include operating system environment 224 .\n* the operating system environment 224 can include any operating system, such as a network operating system, embedded operating system, etc.\n* Operating system environment 224 can include processes, functions, and applications for performing networking, routing, switching, forwarding, policy implementation, messaging, monitoring, and other types of operations.\n* Leaf router 104 A can also include capturing agent 226 .\n* Capturing agent 226 can be an agent or sensor configured to capture network data, such as flows or packets, sent received, or processed by leaf router 104 A .\n* Capturing agent 226 can also be configured to capture other information, such as processes, statistics, users, alerts, status information, device information, etc.\n* capturing agent 226 can be configured to report captured data to a remote device or network, such as collector 118 shown in FIG. 1 , for example.\n* Capturing agent 226 can report information using one or more network addresses associated with leaf router 104 A or collector 118 .\n* capturing agent 226 can be configured to report information using an IP assigned to an active communications interface on leaf router 104 A .\n* Leaf router 104 A can be configured to route traffic to and from other devices or networks, such as server 106 A . Accordingly, capturing agent 226 can also report data reported by other capturing agents on other devices. For example, leaf router 104 A can be configured to route traffic sent and received by server 106 A to other devices. Thus, data reported from capturing agents deployed on server 106 A , such as VM and hypervisor capturing agents on server 106 A , would also be observed by capturing agent 226 and can thus be reported by capturing agent 226 as data observed at leaf router 104 A . Such report can be a control flow generated by capturing agent 226 . Data reported by the VM and hypervisor capturing agents on server 106 A can therefore be a subset of the data reported by capturing agent 226 .\n* Capturing agent 226 can run as a process or component (e.g., firmware, module, hardware device, etc.) in leaf router 104 A . Moreover, capturing agent 226 can be installed on leaf router 104 A as a software or firmware agent. In some configurations, leaf router 104 A itself can act as capturing agent 226 . Moreover, capturing agent 226 can run within operating system 224 and/or separate from operating system 224 .\n* capturing agent 226 can run as a process or component (e.g., firmware, module, hardware device, etc.) in leaf router 104 A .\n* capturing agent 226 can be installed on leaf router 104 A as a software or firmware agent.

Packets or traffic 242 between hypervisor 108 A and leaf router 104 A can flow through server 106 A . Finally, packets or traffic 242 between server 106 A and leaf router 104 A can flow directly to leaf router 104 A . However, in some cases, packets or traffic 242 between server 106 A and leaf router 104 A can flow through one or more intervening devices or networks, such as a switch or a firewall.\n* packets or traffic 242 between server 106 A and leaf router 104 A can flow through one or more intervening devices or networks, such as a switch or a firewall.\n* VM capturing agent 202 A at VM 110 A can send reports 244 (also referred to as control flows) to collector 118 based on the packets or traffic 242 captured at each respective capturing agent.\n* Reports 244 from VM capturing agent 202 A to collector 118 can flow through VM 110 A , hypervisor 108 A , server 106 A , and leaf router 104 A .\n* Reports 244 from hypervisor capturing agent 206 A to collector 118 can flow through hypervisor 108 A , server 106 A , and leaf router 104 A . Reports 244 from any other server capturing agent at server 106 A to collector 118 can flow through server 106 A and leaf router 104 A . Finally, reports 244 from network device capturing agent 226 to collector 118 can flow through leaf router 104 A . Although reports 244 are depicted as being routed separately from traffic 242 in FIG. 2 C , one of ordinary skill in the art will understand that reports 244 and traffic 242 can be transmitted through the same communication channel(s).\n* Reports 244 can include any portion of packets or traffic 242 captured at the respective capturing agents. Reports 244 can also include other information, such as timestamps, process information, capturing agent identifiers, flow identifiers, flow statistics, notifications, logs, user information, system information, etc. Some or all of this information can be appended to reports 244 as one or more labels, metadata, or as part of the packet(s)' header, trailer, or payload.\n* VM capturing agent 202 A of VM 110 A can determine which user (i.e., operating system user) of VM 110 A (e.g., username âjohndoe85â) and which process being executed on the operating system of VM 110 A (e.g., âchrome.exeâ) were responsible for the particular network flow to and from examplewebsite.com. Once such information is determined, the information can be included in report 244 as labels for example, and report 244 can be transmitted from VM capturing agent 202 A to collector 118 . Such additional information can help system 240 to gain insight into flow information at the process and user level, for instance. This information can be used for security, optimization, and determining structures and dependencies within system 240 .\n* the reports 244 can include various statistics and/or usage information reported by the respective capturing agents.\n* the reports 244 can indicate an amount of traffic captured by the respective capturing agent, which can include the amount of traffic sent, received, and generated by the capturing agent's host; a type of traffic captured, such as video, audio, Web (e.g., HTTP or HTTPS), database queries, application traffic, etc.; a source and/or destination of the traffic, such as a destination server or application, a source network or device, a source or destination address or name (e.g., IP address, DNS name, FQDN, packet label, MAC address, VLAN, VNID, VxLAN, source or destination domain, etc.); a source and/or destination port (e.g., port 25 , port 80 , port 443 , port 8080 , port 22 ); a traffic protocol; traffic metadata; etc.\n* the reports 244 can also include indications of traffic or usage patterns and information, such as frequency of communications, intervals, type of requests,\n* Each of the capturing agents 202 A , 206 A . 226 can include a respective unique capturing agent identifier on each of reports 244 it sends to collector 118 , to allow collector 118 to determine which capturing agent sent the report.\n* Capturing agent identifiers in reports 244 can also be used to determine which capturing agents reported what flows. This information can then be used to determine capturing agent placement and topology, as further described below, as well as mapping individual flows to processes and users. Such additional insights gained can be useful for analyzing the data in reports 244 , as well as troubleshooting, security, visualization, configuration, planning, and management, and so forth.\n* the topology of the capturing agents can be ascertained from the reports 244 .\n* a packet received by VM 110 A from fabric 112 can be captured and reported by VM capturing agent 202 A . Since the packet received by VM 110 A will also flow through leaf router 104 A and hypervisor 108 A , it can also be captured and reported by hypervisor capturing agent 206 A and network device capturing agent 226 . Thus, for a packet received by VM 110 A from fabric 112 , collector 118 can receive a report of the packet from VM capturing agent 202 A , hypervisor capturing agent 206 A , and network device capturing agent 226 .\n* a packet sent by VM 110 A to fabric 112 can be captured and reported by VM capturing agent 202 A . Since the packet sent by VM 10 A will also flow through leaf router 104 A and hypervisor 108 A , it can also be captured and reported by hypervisor capturing agent 206 A and network device capturing agent 226 . Thus, for a packet sent by VM 10 A to fabric 112 , collector 118 can receive a report of the packet from VM capturing agent 202 A , hypervisor capturing agent 206 A , and network device capturing agent 226 .\n* a packet originating at, or destined to, hypervisor 108 A can be captured and reported by hypervisor capturing agent 206 A and network device capturing agent 226 , but not VM capturing agent 202 A , as such packet may not flow through VM 110 A .\n* a packet originating at, or destined to, leaf router 104 A will be captured and reported by network device capturing agent 226 , but not VM capturing agent 202 A , hypervisor capturing agent 206 A , or any other capturing agent on server 106 A , as such packet may not flow through VM 110 A , hypervisor 108 A , or server 106 A .\n* Information ascertained or inferred about the topology of the capturing agents can also be used with the reports 244 to detect problems.\n* the inferred topology of the capturing agents can be used with the current and/or historical statistics included in the reports 244 to infer or detect various conditions.\n* traffic to and from fabric 112 captured by VM capturing agent 202 should also be captured by hypervisor capturing agent 206 and network device capturing agent 226 .\n* VM capturing agent 202 reports 200 packets to or from fabric 112 during a period of time and network device capturing agent 226 only reports 20 packets to or from fabric 112 during that same period of time, then one can infer from this discrepancy that VM capturing agent 202 has reported and/or captured an abnormal or unexpected number of packets during that period of time.\n* This abnormal activity can be determined to indicate a faulty state of the VM capturing agent 202 , such as an error, a bug, malware, a virus, or a compromised condition.\n* reports 244 can also be considered for determining problems or faults with capturing agents and/or hosts. For example, if hypervisor capturing agent 206 has typically reported in the past an average of 10 K server hits (e.g., Web, email, database, etc.) every 7 days, and reports 244 indicate a spike of 50 K server hits over the last 2 days, then one can infer that this abnormal levels of activity indicate a problem with the hypervisor capturing agent 206 and/or its host (i.e., hypervisor 108 or server 106 ). The abnormal levels of activity can be a result of malware or a virus affecting the hypervisor capturing agent 206 .\n* K server hits e.g., Web, email, database, etc.\n* the reports 244 indicate that the VM capturing agent 202 has been generating unexpected, improper, or excessive traffic, such as sending packets or commands to a new or different device other than collector 118 âor other than any other system with which VM capturing agent 202 is expected or configured to communicate withâor sending the wrong types of packets (e.g., other than reports 244 ) or sending traffic at unexpected times or events (e.g., without being triggered by a predefined setting or event such as the capturing of a packet processed by the host), then one can assume that VM capturing agent 202 has been compromised or is being manipulated by an unauthorized user or device.\n* unexpected, improper, or excessive traffic such as sending packets or commands to a new or different device other than collector 118 âor other than any other system with which VM capturing agent 202 is expected or configured to communicate withâor sending the wrong types of packets (e.g., other than reports 244 ) or sending traffic at unexpected times or events (e.g., without being triggered by a\n* Reports 244 can be transmitted to collector 118 periodically as new packets or traffic 242 are captured by a capturing agent, or otherwise based on a schedule, interval, or event, for example. Further, each capturing agent can send a single report or multiple reports to collector 118 . For example, each of the capturing agents can be configured to send a report to collector 118 for every flow, packet, message, communication, or network data received, transmitted, and/or generated by its respective host (e.g., VM 110 A , hypervisor 108 A , server 106 A , and leaf router 104 A ). As such, collector 118 can receive a report of a same packet from multiple capturing agents.\n* host e.g., VM 110 A , hypervisor 108 A , server 106 A , and leaf router 104 A .\n* one or more capturing agents can be configured to send a report to collector 118 for one or more flows, packets, messages, communications, network data, or subset(s) thereof, received, transmitted, and/or generated by the respective host during a period of time or interval.\n* FIG. 3 illustrates a schematic diagram of an example configuration 300 for collecting capturing agent reports (i.e., control flows).\n* traffic between fabric 112 and VM 110 A is configured to flow through hypervisor 108 A .\n* traffic between fabric 112 and hypervisor 108 A is configured to flow through leaf router 104 A .\n* VM capturing agent 202 A can be configured to report to collector 118 traffic sent, received, or processed by VM 110 A .\n* Hypervisor capturing agent 210 can be configured to report to collector 118 traffic sent, received, or processed by hypervisor 108 A .\n* network device capturing agent 226 can be configured to report to collector 118 traffic sent, received, or processed by leaf router 104 A .\n* Collector 118 can thus receive flows 302 from VM capturing agent 202 A , flows 304 from hypervisor capturing agent 206 A , and flows 406 from network device capturing agent 226 .\n* Flows 302 , 304 , and 306 can include control flows.\n* Flows 302 can include flows captured by VM capturing agent 202 A at VM 110 A .\n* Flows 304 can include flows captured by hypervisor capturing agent 206 A at hypervisor 108 A .\n* Flows captured by hypervisor capturing agent 206 A can also include flows 302 captured by VM capturing agent 202 A , as traffic sent and received by VM 110 A will be received and observed by hypervisor 108 A and captured by hypervisor capturing agent 206 A .\n* Flows 306 can include flows captured by network device capturing agent 226 at leaf router 104 A .\n* Flows captured by network device capturing agent 226 can also include flows 302 captured by VM capturing agent 202 A and flows 304 captured by hypervisor capturing agent 206 A , as traffic sent and received by VM 110 A and hypervisor 108 A is routed through leaf router 104 A and can thus be captured by network device capturing agent 226 .\n* Collector 118 can collect flows 302 , 304 , and 306 , and store the reported data. Collector 118 can also forward some or all of flows 302 , 304 , and 306 , and/or any respective portion thereof, to engine 120 .\n* Engine 120 can process the information, including any information about the capturing agents (e.g., agent placement, agent environment, etc.) and/or the captured traffic (e.g., statistics), received from collector 118 to identify patterns, conditions, network or device characteristics; log statistics or history details; aggregate and/or process the data; generate reports, timelines, alerts, graphical user interfaces; detect errors, events, inconsistencies; troubleshoot networks or devices; configure networks or devices; deploy services or devices; reconfigure services, applications, devices, or networks; etc.\n* the capturing agents e.g., agent placement, agent environment, etc.\n* the captured traffic e.g., statistics\n* Collector 118 and/or engine 120 can map individual flows that traverse VM 110 A , hypervisor 108 A , and/or leaf router 104 A to the specific capturing agents at VM 110 A , hypervisor 108 A , and/or leaf router 104 A . For example, collector 118 or engine 120 can determine that a particular flow that originated from VM 110 A and destined for fabric 112 was sent by VM 110 A and such flow was reported by VM capturing agent 202 . It may be determined that the same flow was received by a process named Z on hypervisor 108 A and forwarded to a process named W on leaf router 104 A and also reported by hypervisor capturing agent 206 .\n* engine 120 is illustrated as a separate entity, other configurations are also contemplated herein.\n* engine 120 can be part of collector 118 and/or a separate entity.\n* engine 120 can include one or more devices, applications, modules, databases, processing components, elements, etc.\n* collector 118 can represent one or more collectors.\n* collector 118 can include multiple collection systems or entities, which can reside in one or more networks.\n* FIG. 4 For the sake of clarity, the method is described in terms of collector 118 and capturing agents 116 , as shown in FIG. 1 , configured to practice the various steps in the method.\n* host 106 C in FIG. 1 represents the computing device performing the steps of the claim to both receive network traffic and analysis a malware tracker, which for this example shall be host or server 106 D .\n* network server under analysis is server/computing device 106 B .\n* the goal is to evaluate whether device 106 B has malware or likely to get malware on it.\n* the example methods can be practiced by any software or hardware components, devices, etc. heretofore disclosed.\n* the steps outlined herein are exemplary and can be implemented in any combination thereof in any order, including combinations that exclude, add, or modify certain steps.\n* the current disclosure implements sensors or capturing agents within various hosts and layers in a network, such as VMs, hypervisors, servers, and hardware switches which capture data sent and received at each of these points and reports the data to a collector which can process, store, aggregate, manipulate, and/or analyze the data, and maintain the reported, sensed data.\n* the collector can transmit the collected data from each sensor to the pipeline (e.g., particular engine), which can analyze any portion of the data and identify precise amounts of packet loss at each point.\n* the pipeline can identify packet loss at each point by comparing data or packets captured and reported by capturing agents at each point. This comparison can be performed per flow, per link, per hop, per layer, per process and/or on a host basis.\n* the information can affect a reputation score for a respective component in the network.\n* the pipeline can perform the comparison for data captured within a specific time window. For example, the pipeline can compare data from each point within a 30 minute time window. The pipeline can then identify packet loss at each point and determine if there is a problem at a specific point within the link, path, or flow. For example, the pipeline can analyze an aggregate of data captured for a 30 minute window of communications from S 1 to H 1 to S 2 . Based on the aggregated data, the pipeline can determine that S 1 reported 100% of the packets. H 1 reported 90% of the packets, and S 2 reported 80% of the packets. Here, the pipeline can thus determine that there is a 10% packet loss at each of H 1 and S 2 .\n* the concepts disclosed herein allow a centralized system to collect and aggregate data captured from sensors at each point within a communication path over a specific period of time and compare the information reported at each point to identify packet loss at each point.\n* This mechanism can be implemented in a live environment and can accurately and efficiently ascertain packet loss at each point within a network.\n* FIG. 4 illustrates a method aspect of this disclosure.\n* An exemplary method can be performed by a system or any computing device whether physical or virtual.\n* the method includes receiving network traffic (at server 106 C ) from a host (Server 106 A ) having a host IP address and operating in a data center ( 402 ), and analyzing a malware tracker for IP addresses of hosts having been infected by a malware (server 106 D ) to yield an analysis ( 404 ).\n* Data associated with the network traffic can be received from at least a first capture agent at a device hardware layer of the data center, a second capture agent at a hypervisor layer of the data center, and a third capture agent at a virtual machine layer of the data center.\n* the method includes assigning a reputation score, based on the indication, to the host ( 406 ).\n* the method can further include applying a conditional policy associated with using the host based on the reputation score.\n* the reputation score can include a reduced reputation score from a previous reputation score for the host. Reputation scores can go up or down based on continued negative activity or a period of positive activity.\n* the host in this case can also be at any layer of the data center, such as the virtual layer, the hypervisor layer or the physical layer.\n* the method can include analyzing an effectiveness of a policy related to communications with the host based on the reputation score. For example, if a low reputation score is supposed to prevent certain packet flows to the server, then the system can capture that data associated with the packet flows for analysis and determine whether to proceed and how to proceed.\n* the method can also include separating malicious and non-malicious behavior based on the indication. Analyzing the malware tracker can mean crawling multiple malware trackers. In this case, assume that server 106 D represents two or more servers, each server acting as a malware tracker.\n* assigning the reputation score is further based on data associated with the host and received from a whois (or similar) database.\n* the whois database is a query and response protocol that is used for querying databases that store the registered users or assignees of an internet resource such as a domain name, an IP address block, or an autonomous system. It can be used for other information as well.\n* Reputation scores can relate to vulnerability indexes, security strength, a trust level for different types of communication with a device, and so forth. They can be derived from one or more of an external source or sources, such as malware trackers or whois, or travel data which is easy to obtain, and/or data obtained from the various layers of a network including a physical layer, a hypervisor layer and a virtual layer. Reputation scores can be identified and tracked using the various layers of capture agents disclosed herein. In other words, the selection of reputation scores and tracking of reputations for devices can be based, at least in part, on capture agents configured in a device hardware layer 104 A , a hypervisor layer 108 A , and/or a virtual machine layer 110 . The data obtained from these capture agents can also be coordinated with external data or other data to arrive at a reputation score. The reputation scores can also be applied to applications and can govern what level of access they may have to particular devices/entities in a network.\n* More advanced reputation score management can occur. For example, if there is a hypervisor that has a high reputation, assume that the system is about to deploy a virtual machine that might have a lower reputation. In this case, the system might determine that deploying such a virtual machine might negatively affect the desired reputation of the hypervisor and therefore select a different host for the virtual machine or might implement the virtual machine with policies to prevent it from achieving a low reputation score. Thus, the high reputation of the hypervisor can be maintained for virtual devices that are provisioned within the hypervisor. Thus, reputations for one layer of the network can be managed through control of provisioning or management of entities in a different layer. The approach can apply to higher layers or lower layers to the layer in which an entity is being provisioned.\n* the hypervisors will each have a virtual switch and each virtual machine can also have a virtual network interface.\n* each virtual machine can also have a virtual network interface.\n* FIG. 5 illustrates a listing 500 of example fields on a capturing agent report.\n* the listing 500 can include one or more fields, such as:\n* Flow identifier (e.g., unique identifier associated with the flow).\n* Capturing agent identifier e.g., data uniquely identifying reporting capturing agent.\n* Timestamp (e.g., time of event, report, etc.).\n* Interval e.g., time between current report and previous report, interval between flows or packets, interval between events, etc.\n* Duration e.g., duration of event, duration of communication, duration of flow, duration of report, etc.\n* Flow direction (e.g., egress flow, ingress flow, etc.).\n* Application identifier e.g., identifier of application associated with flow, process, event, or data.\n* Port e.g., source port, destination port, layer 4 port, etc.\n* Destination address (e.g., interface address associated with destination, IP address, domain name, network address, hardware address, virtual address, physical address, etc.).\n* Source address e.g., interface address associated with source, IP address, domain name, network address, hardware address, virtual address, physical address, etc.\n* Interface e.g., interface address, interface information, etc.\n* Protocol e.g., layer 4 protocol, layer 3 protocol, etc.\n* Event e.g., description of event, event identifier, etc.\n* Flag e.g., layer 3 flag, flag options, etc.\n* Tag e.g., virtual local area network tag, etc.\n* Process e.g., process identifier, etc.\n* Bytes e.g., flow size, packet size, transmission size, etc.\n* Sensor Type e.g., the type of virtualized environment hosting the capturing agent, such as hypervisor or VM; the type of virtual network device, such as VNIC, LINUX bridge, OVS, software switch, etc.).\n* the listing 500 includes a non-limiting example of fields in a report.\n* Other fields and data items are also contemplated herein, such as handshake information, system information, network address associated with capturing agent or host, operating system environment information, network data or statistics, process statistics, system statistics, etc.\n* the order in which these fields are illustrated is also exemplary and can be rearranged in any other way.\n* One or more of these fields can be part of a header, a trailer, or a payload of in one or more packets.\n* one or more of these fields can be applied to the one or more packets as labels.\n* Each of the fields can include data, metadata, and/or any other information relevant to the fields.\n* the disclosure now turns to the example network device and system illustrated in FIGS. 6 and 7 A -B.\n* FIG. 6 illustrates an example network device 610 according to some embodiments.\n* Network device 610 includes a master central processing unit (CPU) 662 , interfaces 668 , and a bus 615 (e.g., a PCI bus).\n* CPU central processing unit\n* the CPU 662 is responsible for executing packet management, error detection, and/or routing functions.\n* the CPU 662 preferably accomplishes all these functions under the control of software including an operating system and any appropriate applications software.\n* CPU 662 may include one or more processors 663 such as a processor from the Motorola family of microprocessors or the MIPS family of microprocessors.\n* processor 663 is specially designed hardware for controlling the operations of router 610 .\n* a memory 661 (such as non-volatile RAM and/or ROM) also forms part of CPU 662 .

No. 17/403,026, filed Aug. 16, 2021, which is a continuation of U.S. Non-Provisional patent application Ser.

No. 10,243,817, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 62/171,899, filed Jun. 5, 2015, the full disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.\nTECHNICAL FIELD\nThe present disclosure pertains to network analytics, and more specifically to a process of analyzing a malware tracker for IP addresses of hosts having been infected by malware and assigning a reputation score to a host based on whether the host IP address has been used to communicate with an external host infected by the malware.\nBACKGROUND\nNetwork architectures for observing and capturing information about network traffic in a datacenter are described herein. Network traffic from a compute environment (whether from a container, VM, hardware switch, hypervisor or physical server) is captured by entities called sensors or capture agents that can be deployed in or inside different environments. Sensors export data or metadata of the observed network activity to collection agents called âcollectors.â Collectors can be a group of processes running on a single machine or a cluster of machines. For the sake of simplicity, collectors can be treated as one logical entity and referred to as one collector. In actual deployment on the datacenter scale, there will be more than just one collector, each responsible for handling export data from a group of sensors. Collectors are capable of doing preprocessing and analysis of the data collected from sensors. The collector is capable of sending the processed or unprocessed data to a cluster of processes responsible for analysis of network data. The entities which receive the data from the collector can be a cluster of processes, and this logical group can be considered or referred to as a âpipeline.â Note that sensors and collectors are not limited to observing and processing just network data, but can also capture other system information like currently active processes, active file handles, socket handles, status of I/O devices, memory, etc.\nA host in a datacenter may at some point interact through a packet flow with a malware infected host or become infected itself. The infection can be very damaging to data, hardware, software and/or privacy. What is needed is an improved ability to determine whether a host has been infected with malware.\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\nIn order to describe the manner in which the above-recited and other advantages and features of the disclosure can be obtained, a more particular description of the principles briefly described above will be rendered by reference to specific embodiments thereof which are illustrated in the appended drawings. Understanding that these drawings depict only exemplary embodiments of the disclosure and are not therefore to be considered to be limiting of its scope, the principles herein are described and explained with additional specificity and detail through the use of the accompanying drawings in which:\nFIG. **1** illustrates a diagram of an example network environment;\nFIG. **2** A illustrates a schematic diagram of an example capturing agent deployment in a virtualized environment;\nFIG. **2** B illustrates a schematic diagram of an example capturing agent deployment in an example network device;\nFIG. **2** C illustrates a schematic diagram of an example reporting system in an example capturing agent topology;\nFIG. **3** illustrates a schematic diagram of an example configuration for collecting capturing agent reports;\nFIG. **4** illustrates an example method embodiment:\nFIG. **5** illustrates a listing of example fields on a capturing agent report;\nFIG. **6** illustrates an example network device; and\nFIGS. **7** A and **7** B illustrate example system embodiments.\nDESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS\nVarious embodiments of the disclosure are discussed in detail below. While specific implementations are discussed, it should be understood that this is done for illustration purposes only. A person skilled in the relevant art will recognize that other components and configurations may be used without parting from the spirit and scope of the disclosure.\nOverview\nIt is important to identify the amount of packet loss at each point in a network and to fine tune and improve the network. Prior art solutions noted above implement a request/reply model when trying to identify packet loss at different points. However, unlike the concepts disclosed herein, the prior model cannot be implemented in a live environment. Moreover, the model is not as efficient or accurate as the concepts disclosed herein.\nAdditional features and advantages of the disclosure will be set forth in the description which follows, and in part will be obvious from the description, or can be learned by practice of the herein disclosed principles. The features and advantages of the disclosure can be realized and obtained by means of the instruments and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims. These and other features of the disclosure will become more fully apparent from the following description and appended claims, or can be learned by the practice of the principles set forth herein.\nDisclosed are systems, methods, and computer-readable storage media for receiving network traffic from a host having a host IP address and operating in a data center, and analyzing a malware tracker for IP addresses of hosts having been infected by a malware. When the analysis indicates that the host IP address has been used to communicate with an external host infected by the malware, the method includes assigning a reputation score, based on the indication, to the host. The method can further include applying a conditional policy associated with using the host based on the reputation score. The reputation score can include a reduced reputation score from a previous reputation score for the host. Reputation scores can go up or down based on continued negative or positive activity or a period of negative or positive activity.\nThe method can include analyzing an effectiveness of a policy related to communications with the host based on the reputation score. The method can also include separating malicious and non-malicious behavior based on the indication. Analyzing the malware tracker can mean crawling multiple malware trackers. Finally, assigning the reputation score is further based on data associated with the host and received from a whois database.\nDescription\nThe disclosed technology addresses the need in the art for identifying malicious processes within a network. A description of an example network environment, as illustrated in FIG. **1** , is first disclosed herein. A discussion of capturing agents will then follow. The disclosure continues with a discussion of the specific process for determining whether a host is infected or may become infected with malware. The discussion then concludes with a description of example systems and devices. These variations shall be described herein as the various embodiments are set forth.\nThe system disclosed herein introduces the concept of âreputationâ or a âvulnerability indexâ for a host in a datacenter or any compute environment. The reputation score or vulnerability index can be helpful for a variety of use cases, such as enabling conditional policies based on reputation/vulnerability, separating malicious versus non-malicious behavior, and determining effectiveness of policies, targeting and implementing policies for specific application or service endpoint groups (EPGs) in a software-defined network (SDN), among other examples. In one example, a host can have a âGood,â âOK.â or âBadâ reputation, although there can be more or fewer classifications in other embodiments.\nFurther, thresholds for the classifications can be configured by the user based on, for example, preferences, service level agreements (SLAs), sensitivity of services provided by the associated applications, privacy or security expectations or requirements, etc. In another example, a host may be designated as âGoodâ if it has a reputation between 0.7 and 1 (assuming a reputation scale of â1 to 1), âOKâ if it has a reputation less than 0.7 but greater than 0, and âBadâ if it has a negative reputation. The reputation score can be calculated exclusively from analysis of network traffic or activity in a data center. The network data can be obtained through the sensor/collector system and at one or more layers within the network (e.g., underlay and overlay; a physical layer and one or more virtual layers such as a container layer, a hypervisor layer, a virtual machine layer, etc.).\nBut the system can also leverage external sources for further enhancing reputation scores. For example, the system can crawl malware trackers (e.g., https://zeustracker.abuse.ch/monitor.php?filter=all), which identify IP addresses that have been infected by particular malware. The reputation of a host in a data center can be reduced if that host has communicated with an external host that has been infected by malware. The system can also crawl whois to determine what IP addresses have been properly allocated to legitimate entities. If a host in a data center is communicating with an unallocated IP address, the system can reduce the reputation of that host. Reputations or vulnerabilities can be quantified for hosts in a data center. Reputation scores or vulnerability indexes can be derived from external sources, such as malware trackers or whois and optionally can utilize that data with the travel data. Reputation scores can also be identified, established and/or tracked using capture agents positioned within the various layers of a network as disclosed herein. In other words, the selection of reputation scores and tracking of reputations for devices can be based on capture agents configured in a device hardware layer **104** A, a hypervisor layer **108** A, and/or a virtual machine layer **110** A. The reputation of a host can also be reduced if that host has communicated with an entity in a certain âhigh riskâ geographic location (e.g., countries or jurisdictions having higher statistical numbers of originating hacking events, etc.).\nThe disclosure now turns to FIG. **1** . FIG. **1** illustrates a diagram of example network environment **100**. Fabric **112** can represent the underlay (i.e., physical network) of network environment **100**. Fabric **112** can include spine routers **1** -N (**102** A-N) (collectively â**102** â) and leaf routers **1** -N (**104** A-N) (collectively â**104** â). Leaf routers **104** can reside at the edge of fabric **112** , and can thus represent the physical network edges. Leaf routers **104** can be, for example, top-of-rack (âToRâ) switches, aggregation switches, gateways, ingress and/or egress switches, provider edge devices, and/or any other type of routing or switching device.\nLeaf routers **104** can be responsible for routing and/or bridging tenant or endpoint packets and applying network policies. Spine routers **102** can perform switching and routing within fabric **112**. Thus, network connectivity in fabric **112** can flow from spine routers **102** to leaf routers **104** , and vice versa.\nLeaf routers **104** can provide servers **1** -**4** (**106** A-D) (collectively â**106** â), hypervisors **1** -**3** (**108** A-**108** C) (collectively â**108** â), virtual machines (VMs) **1** -**4** (**110** A-**110** D) (collectively â**110** â), collectors **118** , engines **120** , and the Layer 2 (L2) network access to fabric **112**. For example, leaf routers **104** can encapsulate and decapsulate packets to and from servers **106** in order to enable communications throughout environment **100**. Leaf routers **104** can also connect other network-capable device(s) or network(s), such as a firewall, a database, a server, etc., to the fabric **112**. Leaf routers **104** can also provide any other servers, resources, endpoints, external networks, VMs, services, tenants, or workloads with access to fabric **112**.\nVMs **110** can be virtual machines hosted by hypervisors **108** running on servers **106**. VMs **110** can include workloads running on a guest operating system on a respective server. Hypervisors **108** can provide a layer of software, firmware, and/or hardware that creates and runs the VMs **110**. Hypervisors **108** can allow VMs **110** to share hardware resources on servers **106** , and the hardware resources on servers **106** to appear as multiple, separate hardware platforms. Moreover, hypervisors **108** and servers **106** can host one or more VMs **110**. For example, server **106** A and hypervisor **108** A can host VMs **110** A-B.\nIn some cases. VMs **110** and/or hypervisors **108** can be migrated to other servers **106**. For example, VM **110** A can be migrated to server **106** C and hypervisor **108** B. Servers **106** can similarly be migrated to other locations in network environment **100**. For example, a server connected to a specific leaf router can be changed to connect to a different or additional leaf router. In some cases, some or all of servers **106** , hypervisors **108** , and/or VMs **110** can represent tenant space. Tenant space can include workloads, services, applications, devices, and/or resources that are associated with one or more clients or subscribers. Accordingly, traffic in network environment **100** can be routed based on specific tenant policies, spaces, agreements, configurations, etc. Moreover, addressing can vary between one or more tenants. In some configurations, tenant spaces can be divided into logical segments and/or networks and separated from logical segments and/or networks associated with other tenants.\nIn the present disclosure, the  various servers **106** A, **106** B, **106** C and **106** D shall be used to discuss the concepts related to detecting whether a host or server has been infected with malware. This can be accomplished by studying network data and/or analyzing a malware tracker or malware trackers.\nAny of leaf routers **104** , servers **106** , hypervisors **108** , and VMs **110** can include capturing agent **116** (also referred to as a âsensorâ or a âcapturing agentâ) configured to capture network data, and report any portion of the captured data to collector **118**. Capturing agents **116** can be processes, agents, modules, drivers, or components deployed on a respective system or system layer (e.g., a server, VM, virtual container, hypervisor, leaf router, bare metal switch, etc.), configured to capture network data for the respective system (e.g., data received or transmitted by the respective system), and report some or all of the captured data and statistics to collector **118**\nFor example, a VM capturing agent can run as a process, kernel module, software element, or kernel driver on the guest operating system installed in a VM and configured to capture and report data (e.g., network and/or system data) processed (e.g., sent, received, generated, etc.) by the VM.\nA hypervisor capturing agent can run as a process, kernel module, software element, or kernel driver on the host operating system installed at the hypervisor layer and configured to capture and report data (e.g., network and/or system data) processed (e.g., sent, received, generated, etc.) by the hypervisor.\nA container capturing agent can run as a process, kernel module, software element, or kernel driver on the operating system of a device, such as a switch or server, which can be configured to capture and report data processed by the container.\nA server capturing agent can run as a process, kernel module, software element, or kernel driver on the host operating system of a server and configured to capture and report data (e.g., network and/or system data) processed (e.g., sent, received, generated, etc.) by the server.\nA network device capturing agent can run as a process, software element, or component in a network device, such as leaf routers **104** , and configured to capture and report data (e.g., network and/or system data) processed (e.g., sent, received, generated, etc.) by the network device.\nCapturing agents **116** can be configured to report observed data, statistics, and/or metadata about one or more packets, flows, communications, processes, events, and/or activities to collector **118**. For example, capturing agents **116** can capture network data and statistics processed (e.g., sent, received, generated, dropped, forwarded, etc.) by the system or host (e.g., server, hypervisor, VM, container, switch, etc.) of the capturing agents **116** (e.g., where the capturing agents **116** are deployed). The capturing agents **116** can also report the network data and statistics to one or more devices, such as collectors **118** and/or engines **120**. For example, the capturing agents **116** can report an amount of traffic processed by their host, a frequency of the traffic processed by their host, a type of traffic processed (e.g., sent, received, generated, etc.) by their host, a source or destination of the traffic processed by their host, a pattern in the traffic, an amount of traffic dropped or blocked by their host, types of requests or data in the traffic received, discrepancies in traffic (e.g., spoofed addresses, invalid addresses, hidden sender, etc.), protocols used in communications, type or characteristics of responses to traffic by the hosts of the capturing agents **116** , what processes have triggered specific packets, etc.\nCapturing agents **116** can also capture and report information about the system or host of the capturing agents **116** (e.g., type of host, type of environment, status of host, conditions of the host, etc.). Such information can include, for example, data or metadata of active or previously active processes of the system, operating system user identifiers, kernel modules loaded or used, network software characteristics (e.g., software switch, virtual network card, etc.), metadata of files on the system, system alerts, number and/or identity of applications at the host, domain information, networking information (e.g., address, topology, settings, connectivity, etc.), session information (e.g., session identifier), faults or errors, memory or CPU usage, threads, filename and/or path, services, security information or settings, and so forth.\nCapturing agents **116** may also analyze the processes running on the respective VMs, hypervisors, servers, or network devices to determine specifically which process is responsible for a particular flow of network traffic. Similarly, capturing agents **116** may determine which operating system user (e.g., root, system, John Doe, Admin, etc.) is responsible for a given flow. Reported data from capturing agents **116** can provide details or statistics particular to one or more tenants or customers. For example, reported data from a subset of capturing agents **116** deployed throughout devices or elements in a tenant space can provide information about the performance, use, quality, events, processes, security status, characteristics, statistics, patterns, conditions, configurations, topology, and/or any other information for the particular tenant space.\nCollectors **118** can be one or more devices, modules, workloads, VMs, containers, and/or processes capable of receiving data from capturing agents **116**. Collectors **118** can thus collect reports and data from capturing agents **116**. Collectors **118** can be deployed anywhere in network environment **100** and/or even on remote networks capable of communicating with network environment **100**. For example, one or more collectors can be deployed within fabric **112** , on the L2 network, or on one or more of the servers **106** , VMs **110** , hypervisors. Collectors **118** can be hosted on a server or a cluster of seers, for example. In some cases, collectors **118** can be implemented in one or more servers in a distributed fashion.\nAs previously noted, collectors **118** can include one or more collectors. Moreover, a collector can be configured to receive reported data from all capturing agents **116** or a subset of capturing agents **116**. For example, a collector can be assigned to a subset of capturing agents **116** so the data received by that specific collector is limited to data from the subset of capturing agents **116**. Collectors **118** can be configured to aggregate data from all capturing agents **116** and/or a subset of capturing agents **116**. Further, collectors **118** can be configured to analyze some or all of the data reported by capturing agents **116**.\nEnvironment **100** can include one or more analytics engines **120** configured to analyze the data reported to collectors **118**. For example, engines **120** can be configured to receive collected data from collectors **118** , aggregate the data, analyze the data (individually and/or aggregated), generate reports, identify conditions, compute statistics, visualize reported data, troubleshoot conditions, visualize the network and/or portions of the network (e.g., a tenant space), generate alerts, identify patterns, calculate misconfigurations, identify errors, generate suggestions, generate testing, detect compromised elements (e.g., capturing agents **116** , devices, servers, switches, etc.), and/or perform any other analytics functions.\nEngines **120** can include one or more modules or software programs for performing such analytics. Further, engines **120** can reside on one or more servers, devices, VMs, nodes, etc. For example, engines **120** can be separate VMs or servers, an individual VM or server, or a cluster of servers or applications. Engines **120** can reside within the fabric **112** , within the L2 network, outside of the environment **100** (e.g., WAN **114**), in one or more segments or networks coupled with the fabric **112** (e.g., overlay network coupled with the fabric **112**), etc. Engines **120** can be coupled with the fabric **112** via the leaf switches **104** , for example.\nWhile collectors **118** and engines **120** are shown as separate entities, this is simply a non-limiting example for illustration purposes, as other configurations are also contemplated herein. For example, any of collectors **118** and engines **120** can be part of a same or separate entity. Moreover, any of the collector, aggregation, and analytics functions can be implemented by one entity (e.g., a collector **118** or engine **120**) or separately implemented by multiple entities (e.g., engines **120** and/or collectors **118**).\nEach of the capturing agents **116** can use a respective address (e.g., internet protocol (IP) address, port number, etc.) of their host to send information to collectors **118** and/or any other destination. Collectors **118** may also be associated with their respective addresses such as IP addresses. Moreover, capturing agents **116** can periodically send information about flows they observe to collectors **118**. Capturing agents **116** can be configured to report each and every flow they observe or a subset of flows they observe. For example, capturing agents **116** can report every flow always, every flow within a period of time, every flow at one or more intervals, or a subset of flows during a period of time or at one or more intervals.\nCapturing agents **116** can report a list of flows that were active during a period of time (e.g., between the current time and the time of the last report). The consecutive periods of time of observance can be represented as pre-defined or adjustable time series. The series can be adjusted to a specific level of granularity. Thus, the time periods can be adjusted to control the level of details in statistics and can be customized based on specific requirements or conditions, such as security, scalability, bandwidth, storage, etc. The time series information can also be implemented to focus on more important flows or components (e.g., VMs) by varying the time intervals. The communication channel between a capturing agent and collector **118** can also create a flow in every reporting interval. Thus, the information transmitted or reported by capturing agents **116** can also include information about the flow created by the communication channel.\nWhen referring to a capturing agent's host herein, the host can refer to the physical device or component hosting the capturing agent (e.g., server, networking device, ASIC, etc.), the virtualized environment hosting the capturing agent (e.g., hypervisor, virtual machine, etc.), the operating system hosting the capturing agent (e.g., guest operating system, host operating system, etc.), and/or system layer hosting the capturing agent (e.g., hardware layer, operating system layer, hypervisor layer, virtual machine layer, etc.).\nFIG. **2** A illustrates a schematic diagram of an example capturing agent deployment **200** in a server **106** A. Server **106** A can execute and host one or more VMs **110** A-N (collectively â**110** â). VMs **110** can be configured to run workloads (e.g., applications, services, processes, functions, etc.) based on hardware resources **210** on server **106** A. VMs **110** can run on guest operating systems **204** A-N (collectively â**204** â) on a virtual operating platform provided by hypervisor **108** A. Each VM **110** can run a respective guest operating system **204** which can be the same or different as other guest operating systems **204** associated with other VMs **110** on server **106** A. Each of guest operating systems **204** can execute one or more processes, which may in turn be programs, applications, modules, drivers, services, widgets, etc. Moreover, each VM **110** can have one or more network addresses, such as an internet protocol (IP) address. VMs **110** can thus communicate with hypervisor **108** A, server **106** A, and/or any remote devices or networks using the one or more network addresses.\nHypervisor **108** A (otherwise known as a virtual machine manager or monitor) can be a layer of software, firmware, and/or hardware that creates and runs VMs **110**. Guest operating systems **204** running on VMs **110** can share virtualized hardware resources created by hypervisor **108** A. The virtualized hardware resources can provide the illusion of separate hardware components. Moreover, the virtualized hardware resources can perform as physical hardware components (e.g., memory, storage, processor, network interface, peripherals, etc.), and can be driven by hardware resources **210** on server **106** A. Hypervisor **108** A can have one or more network addresses, such as an internet protocol (IP) address, to communicate with other devices, components, or networks. For example, hypervisor **108** A can have a dedicated IP address which it can use to communicate with VMs **110** , server **106** A, and/or any remote devices or networks.\nHypervisor **108** A can be assigned a network address, such as an IP, with a global scope. For example, hypervisor **108** A can have an IP that can be reached or seen by VMs **110** A-N as well any other devices in the network environment **100** illustrated in FIG. **1** . On the other hand, VMs **110** can have a network address, such as an IP, with a local scope. For example, VM **110** A can have an IP that is within a local network segment where VM **110** A resides and/or which may not be directly reached or seen from other network segments in the network environment **100**.\nHardware resources **210** of server **106** A can provide the underlying physical hardware that drive operations and functionalities provided by server **106** A, hypervisor **108** A, and VMs **110**. Hardware resources **210** can include, for example, one or more memory resources, one or more storage resources, one or more communication interfaces, one or more processors, one or more circuit boards, one or more buses, one or more extension cards, one or more power supplies, one or more antennas, one or more peripheral components, etc.\nServer **106** A can also include one or more host operating systems (not shown). The number of host operating systems can vary by configuration. For example, some configurations can include a dual boot configuration that allows server **106** A to boot into one of multiple host operating systems. In other configurations, server **106** A may run a single host operating system. Host operating systems can run on hardware resources **210**. In some cases, hypervisor **108** A can run on, or utilize, a host operating system on server **106** A. Each of the host operating systems can execute one or more processes, which may be programs, applications, modules, drivers, services, widgets, etc.\nServer **106** A can also have one or more network addresses, such as an IP address, to communicate with other devices, components, or networks. For example, server **106** A can have an IP address assigned to a communications interface from hardware resources **210** , which it can use to communicate with VMs **110** , hypervisor **108** A, leaf router **104** A in FIG. **1** , collectors **118** in FIG. **1** , and/or any remote devices or networks.\nVM capturing agents **202** A-N (collectively â**202** â) can be deployed on one or more of VMs **110**. VM capturing agents **202** can be data and packet inspection agents or sensors deployed on VMs **110** to capture packets, flows, processes, events, traffic, and/or any data flowing into, out of, or through VMs **110**. VM capturing agents **202** can be configured to export or report any data collected or captured by the capturing agents **202** to a remote entity, such as collectors **118** , for example. VM capturing agents **202** can communicate or report such data using a network address of the respective VMs **110** (e.g., VM IP address).\nVM capturing agents **202** can capture and report any traffic (e.g., packets, flows, etc.) sent, received, generated, and/or processed by VMs **110**. For example, capturing agents **202** can report every packet or flow of communication sent and received by VMs **110**. Such communication channel between capturing agents **202** and collectors **108** creates a flow in every monitoring period or interval and the flow generated by capturing agents **202** may be denoted as a control flow. Moreover, any communication sent or received by VMs **110** , including data reported from capturing agents **202** , can create a network flow. VM capturing agents **202** can report such flows in the form of a control flow to a remote device, such as collectors **118** illustrated in FIG. **1** .\nVM capturing agents **202** can report each flow separately or aggregated with other flows. When reporting a flow via a control flow. VM capturing agents **202** can include a capturing agent identifier that identifies capturing agents **202** as reporting the associated flow. VM capturing agents **202** can also include in the control flow a flow identifier, an IP address, a timestamp, metadata, a process ID, an OS username associated with the process ID, a host or environment descriptor (e.g., type of software bridge or virtual network card, type of host such as a hypervisor or VM, etc.), and any other information, as further described below. In addition, capturing agents **202** can append the process and user information (i.e., which process and/or user is associated with a particular flow) to the control flow. The additional information as identified above can be applied to the control flow as labels. Alternatively, the additional information can be included as part of a header, a trailer, or a payload.\nVM capturing agents **202** can also report multiple flows as a set of flows. When reporting a set of flows, VM capturing agents **202** can include a flow identifier for the set of flows and/or a flow identifier for each flow in the set of flows. VM capturing agents **202** can also include one or more timestamps and other information as previously explained.\nVM capturing agents **202** can run as a process, kernel module, or kernel driver on guest operating systems **204** of VMs **110**. VM capturing agents **202** can thus monitor any traffic sent, received, or processed by VMs **110** , any processes running on guest operating systems **204** , any users and user activities on guest operating system **204** , any workloads on VMs **110** , etc.\nHypervisor capturing agent **206** can be deployed on hypervisor **108** A. Hypervisor capturing agent **206** can be a data inspection agent or sensor deployed on hypervisor **108** A to capture traffic (e.g., packets, flows, etc.) and/or data flowing through hypervisor **108** A. Hypervisor capturing agent **206** can be configured to export or report any data collected or captured by hypervisor capturing agent **206** to a remote entity, such as collectors **118** , for example. Hypervisor capturing agent **206** can communicate or report such data using a network address of hypervisor **108** A, such as an IP address of hypervisor **108** A.\nBecause hypervisor **108** A can see traffic and data originating from VMs **110** , hypervisor capturing agent **206** can also capture and report any data (e.g., traffic data) associated with VMs **110**. For example, hypervisor capturing agent **206** can report every packet or flow of communication sent or received by VMs **110** and/or VM capturing agents **202**. Moreover, any communication sent or received by hypervisor **108** A, including data reported from hypervisor capturing agent **206** , can create a network flow. Hypervisor capturing agent **206** can report such flows in the form of a control flow to a remote device, such as collectors **118** illustrated in FIG. **1** . Hypervisor capturing agent **206** can report each flow separately and/or in combination with other flows or data.\nWhen reporting a flow, hypervisor capturing agent **206** can include a capturing agent identifier that identifies hypervisor capturing agent **206** as reporting the flow. Hypervisor capturing agent **206** can also include in the control flow a flow identifier, an IP address, a timestamp, metadata, a process ID, and any other information, as explained below. In addition, capturing agents **206** can append the process and user information (i.e., which process and/or user is associated with a particular flow) to the control flow. The additional information as identified above can be applied to the control flow as labels. Alternatively, the additional information can be included as part of a header, a trailer, or a payload.\nHypervisor capturing agent **206** can also report multiple flows as a set of flows. When reporting a set of flows, hypervisor capturing agent **206** can include a flow identifier for the set of flows and/or a flow identifier for each flow in the set of flows. Hypervisor capturing agent **206** can also include one or more timestamps and other information as previously explained, such as process and user information.\nAs previously explained, any communication captured or reported by VM capturing agents **202** can flow through hypervisor **108** A. Thus, hypervisor capturing agent **206** can observe and capture any flows or packets reported by VM capturing agents **202** , including any control flows. Accordingly, hypervisor capturing agent **206** can also report any packets or flows reported by V M capturing agents **202** and any control flows generated by VM capturing agents **202**. For example, VM capturing agent **202** A on VM **1** (**110** A) captures flow **1** (âF**1** â) and reports F**1** to collector **118** on FIG. **1** . Hypervisor capturing agent **206** on hypervisor **108** A can also see and capture F**1** , as F**1** would traverse hypervisor **108** A when being sent or received by VM **1** (**110** A). Accordingly, hypervisor capturing agent **206** on hypervisor **108** A can also report F**1** to collector **118**. Thus, collector **118** can receive a report of F**1** from VM capturing agent **202** A on VM **1** (**110** A) and another report of F**1** from hypervisor capturing agent **206** on hypervisor **108** A.\nWhen reporting F**1** , hypervisor capturing agent **206** can report F**1** as a message or report that is separate from the message or report of F**1** transmitted by VM capturing agent **202** A on VM **1** (**110** A). However, hypervisor capturing agent **206** can also, or otherwise, report F**1** as a message or report that includes or appends the message or report of F**1** transmitted by VM capturing agent **202** A on VM **1** (**110** A). In other words, hypervisor capturing agent **206** can report F**1** as a separate message or report from VM capturing agent **202** A's message or report of F**1** , and/or a same message or report that includes both a report of F**1** by hypervisor capturing agent **206** and the report of F**1** by VM capturing agent **202** A at VM **1** (**110** A). In this way, VM capturing agents **202** at VMs **110** can report packets or flows received or sent by VMs **110** , and hypervisor capturing agent **206** at hypervisor **108** A can report packets or flows received or sent by hypervisor **108** A, including any flows or packets received or sent by VMs **110** and/or reported by VM capturing agents **202**.\nHypervisor capturing agent **206** can run as a process, kernel module, or kernel driver on the host operating system associated with hypervisor **108** A. Hypervisor capturing agent **206** can thus monitor any traffic sent and received by hypervisor **108** A, any processes associated with hypervisor **108** A, etc.\nServer **106** A can also have server capturing agent **208** running on it. Server capturing agent **208** can be a data inspection agent or sensor deployed on server **106** A to capture data (e.g., packets, flows, traffic data, etc.) on server **106** A. Server capturing agent **208** can be configured to export or report any data collected or captured by server capturing agent **206** to a remote entity, such as collector **118** , for example. Server capturing agent **208** can communicate or report such data using a network address of server **106** A, such as an IP address of server **106** A.\nServer capturing agent **208** can capture and report any packet or flow of communication associated with server **106** A. For example, capturing agent **208** can report every packet or flow of communication sent or received by one or more communication interfaces of server **106** A. Moreover, any communication sent or received by server **106** A, including data reported from capturing  agents **202** and **206** , can create a network flow associated with server **106** A. Server capturing agent **208** can report such flows in the form of a control flow to a remote device, such as collector **118** illustrated in FIG. **1** . Server capturing agent **208** can report each flow separately or in combination. When reporting a flow, server capturing agent **208** can include a capturing agent identifier that identifies server capturing agent **208** as reporting the associated flow. Server capturing agent **208** can also include in the control flow a flow identifier, an IP address, a timestamp, metadata, a process ID, and any other information. In addition, capturing agent **208** can append the process and user information (i.e., which process and/or user is associated with a particular flow) to the control flow. The additional information as identified above can be applied to the control flow as labels. Alternatively, the additional information can be included as part of a header, a trailer, or a payload.\nServer capturing agent **208** can also report multiple flows as a set of flows. When reporting a set of flows, server capturing agent **208** can include a flow identifier for the set of flows and/or a flow identifier for each flow in the set of flows. Server capturing agent **208** can also include one or more timestamps and other information as previously explained.\nAny communications captured or reported by capturing  agents **202** and **206** can flow through server **106** A. Thus, server capturing agent **208** can observe or capture any flows or packets reported by capturing  agents **202** and **206**. In other words, network data observed by capturing  agents **202** and **206** inside VMs **110** and hypervisor **108** A can be a subset of the data observed by server capturing agent **208** on server **106** A. Accordingly, server capturing agent **208** can report any packets or flows reported by capturing  agents **202** and **206** and any control flows generated by capturing  agents **202** and **206**. For example, capturing agent **202** A on VM **1** (**110** A) captures flow **1** (F**1**) and reports F**1** to collector **118** as illustrated on FIG. **1** . Capturing agent **206** on hypervisor **108** A can also observe and capture F**1** , as F**1** would traverse hypervisor **108** A when being sent or received by VM **1** (**110** A). In addition, capturing agent **206** on server **106** A can also see and capture F**1** , as F**1** would traverse server **106** A when being sent or received by VM **1** (**110** A) and hypervisor **108** A. Accordingly, capturing agent **208** can also report F**1** to collector **118**. Thus, collector **118** can receive a report (i.e., control flow) regarding F**1** from capturing agent **202** A on VM **1** (**110** A), capturing agent **206** on hypervisor **108** A, and capturing agent **208** on server **106** A.\nWhen reporting F**1** , server capturing agent **208** can report F**1** as a message or report that is separate from any messages or reports of F**1** transmitted by capturing agent **202** A on VM **1** (**110** A) or capturing agent **206** on hypervisor **108** A. However, server capturing agent **208** can also, or otherwise, report F**1** as a message or report that includes or appends the messages or reports or metadata of F**1** transmitted by capturing agent **202** A on VM **1** (**110** A) and capturing agent **206** on hypervisor **108** A. In other words, server capturing agent **208** can report F**1** as a separate message or report from the messages or reports of F**1** from capturing agent **202** A and capturing agent **206** , and/or a same message or report that includes a report of F**1** by capturing agent **202** A, capturing agent **206** , and capturing agent **208**. In this way, capturing agents **202** at VMs **110** can report packets or flows received or sent by VMs **110** , capturing agent **206** at hypervisor **108** A can report packets or flows received or sent by hypervisor **108** A, including any flows or packets received or sent by VMs **110** and reported by capturing agents **202** , and capturing agent **208** at server **106** A can report packets or flows received or sent by server **106** A, including any flows or packets received or sent by VMs **110** and reported by capturing agents **202** , and any flows or packets received or sent by hypervisor **108** A and reported by capturing agent **206**.\nServer capturing agent **208** can run as a process, kernel module, or kernel driver on the host operating system or a hardware component of server **106** A. Server capturing agent **208** can thus monitor any traffic sent and received by server **106** A, any processes associated with server **106** A, etc.\nIn addition to network data, capturing  agents **202** , **206** , and **208** can capture additional information about the system or environment in which they reside. For example, capturing  agents **202** , **206** , and **208** can capture data or metadata of active or previously active processes of their respective system or environment, operating system user identifiers, metadata of files on their respective system or environment, timestamps, network addressing information, flow identifiers, capturing agent identifiers, etc. Capturing  agents **202** , **206** , and **208**\nMoreover, capturing  agents **202** , **206** , **208** are not specific to any operating system environment, hypervisor environment, network environment, or hardware environment. Thus, capturing  agents **202** , **206** , and **208** can operate in any environment.\nAs previously explained, capturing  agents **202** , **206** , and **208** can send information about the network traffic they observe. This information can be sent to one or more remote devices, such as one or more servers, collectors, engines, etc. Each capturing agent can be configured to send respective information using a network address, such as an IP address, and any other communication details, such as port number, to one or more destination addresses or locations. Capturing  agents **202** , **206** , and **208** can send metadata about one or more flows, packets, communications, processes, events, etc.\nCapturing  agents **202** , **206** , and **208** can periodically report information about each flow or packet they observe. The information reported can contain a list of flows or packets that were active during a period of time (e.g., between the current time and the time at which the last information was reported). The communication channel between the capturing agent and the destination can create a flow in every interval. For example, the communication channel between capturing agent **208** and collector **118** can create a control flow. Thus, the information reported by a capturing agent can also contain information about this control flow. For example, the information reported by capturing agent **208** to collector **118** can include a list of flows or packets that were active at hypervisor **108** A during a period of time, as well as information about the communication channel between capturing agent **206** and collector **118** used to report the information by capturing agent **206**.\nFIG. **2** B illustrates a schematic diagram of example capturing agent deployment **220** in an example network device. The network device is described as leaf router **104** A, as illustrated in FIG. **1** . However, this is for explanation purposes. The network device can be any other network device, such as any other switch, router, etc.\nIn this example, leaf router **104** A can include network resources **222** , such as memory, storage, communication, processing, input, output, and other types of resources. Leaf router **104** A can also include operating system environment **224**. The operating system environment **224** can include any operating system, such as a network operating system, embedded operating system, etc. Operating system environment **224** can include processes, functions, and applications for performing networking, routing, switching, forwarding, policy implementation, messaging, monitoring, and other types of operations.\nLeaf router **104** A can also include capturing agent **226**. Capturing agent **226** can be an agent or sensor configured to capture network data, such as flows or packets, sent received, or processed by leaf router **104** A. Capturing agent **226** can also be configured to capture other information, such as processes, statistics, users, alerts, status information, device information, etc. Moreover, capturing agent **226** can be configured to report captured data to a remote device or network, such as collector **118** shown in FIG. **1** , for example. Capturing agent **226** can report information using one or more network addresses associated with leaf router **104** A or collector **118**. For example, capturing agent **226** can be configured to report information using an IP assigned to an active communications interface on leaf router **104** A.\nLeaf router **104** A can be configured to route traffic to and from other devices or networks, such as server **106** A. Accordingly, capturing agent **226** can also report data reported by other capturing agents on other devices. For example, leaf router **104** A can be configured to route traffic sent and received by server **106** A to other devices. Thus, data reported from capturing agents deployed on server **106** A, such as VM and hypervisor capturing agents on server **106** A, would also be observed by capturing agent **226** and can thus be reported by capturing agent **226** as data observed at leaf router **104** A. Such report can be a control flow generated by capturing agent **226**. Data reported by the VM and hypervisor capturing agents on server **106** A can therefore be a subset of the data reported by capturing agent **226**.\nCapturing agent **226** can run as a process or component (e.g., firmware, module, hardware device, etc.) in leaf router **104** A. Moreover, capturing agent **226** can be installed on leaf router **104** A as a software or firmware agent. In some configurations, leaf router **104** A itself can act as capturing agent **226**. Moreover, capturing agent **226** can run within operating system **224** and/or separate from operating system **224**.\nFIG. **2** C illustrates a schematic diagram of example reporting system **240** in an example capturing agent topology. The capturing agent topology includes capturing agents along a path from a virtualized environment (e.g., VM and hypervisor) to the fabric **112**.\nLeaf router **104** A can route packets or traffic **242** between fabric **112** and server **106** A, hypervisor **108** A, and VM **110** A. Packets or traffic **242** between VM **110** A and leaf router **104** A can flow through hypervisor **108** A and server **106** A. Packets or traffic **242** between hypervisor **108** A and leaf router **104** A can flow through server **106** A. Finally, packets or traffic **242** between server **106** A and leaf router **104** A can flow directly to leaf router **104** A. However, in some cases, packets or traffic **242** between server **106** A and leaf router **104** A can flow through one or more intervening devices or networks, such as a switch or a firewall.\nMoreover. VM capturing agent **202** A at VM **110** A, hypervisor capturing agent **206** A at hypervisor **108** A, network device capturing agent **226** at leaf router **104** A, and any server capturing agent at server **106** A (e.g., capturing agent running on host environment of server **106** A) can send reports **244** (also referred to as control flows) to collector **118** based on the packets or traffic **242** captured at each respective capturing agent. Reports **244** from VM capturing agent **202** A to collector **118** can flow through VM **110** A, hypervisor **108** A, server **106** A, and leaf router **104** A. Reports **244** from hypervisor capturing agent **206** A to collector **118** can flow through hypervisor **108** A, server **106** A, and leaf router **104** A. Reports **244** from any other server capturing agent at server **106** A to collector **118** can flow through server **106** A and leaf router **104** A. Finally, reports **244** from network device capturing agent **226** to collector **118** can flow through leaf router **104** A. Although reports **244** are depicted as being routed separately from traffic **242** in FIG. **2** C, one of ordinary skill in the art will understand that reports **244** and traffic **242** can be transmitted through the same communication channel(s).\nReports **244** can include any portion of packets or traffic **242** captured at the respective capturing agents. Reports **244** can also include other information, such as timestamps, process information, capturing agent identifiers, flow identifiers, flow statistics, notifications, logs, user information, system information, etc. Some or all of this information can be appended to reports **244** as one or more labels, metadata, or as part of the packet(s)' header, trailer, or payload. For example, if a user opens a browser on VM **110** A and navigates to examplewebsite.com, VM capturing agent **202** A of VM **110** A can determine which user (i.e., operating system user) of VM **110** A (e.g., username âjohndoe85â) and which process being executed on the operating system of VM **110** A (e.g., âchrome.exeâ) were responsible for the particular network flow to and from examplewebsite.com. Once such information is determined, the information can be included in report **244** as labels for example, and report **244** can be transmitted from VM capturing agent **202** A to collector **118**. Such additional information can help system **240** to gain insight into flow information at the process and user level, for instance. This information can be used for security, optimization, and determining structures and dependencies within system **240**.\nIn some examples, the reports **244** can include various statistics and/or usage information reported by the respective capturing agents. For example, the reports **244** can indicate an amount of traffic captured by the respective capturing agent, which can include the amount of traffic sent, received, and generated by the capturing agent's host; a type of traffic captured, such as video, audio, Web (e.g., HTTP or HTTPS), database queries, application traffic, etc.; a source and/or destination of the traffic, such as a destination server or application, a source network or device, a source or destination address or name (e.g., IP address, DNS name, FQDN, packet label, MAC address, VLAN, VNID, VxLAN, source or destination domain, etc.); a source and/or destination port (e.g., port **25** , port **80** , port **443** , port **8080** , port **22**); a traffic protocol; traffic metadata; etc. The reports **244** can also include indications of traffic or usage patterns and information, such as frequency of communications, intervals, type of requests, type of responses, triggering processes or events (e.g., causality), resource usage, etc.\nEach of the capturing  agents **202** A, **206** A. **226** can include a respective unique capturing agent identifier on each of reports **244** it sends to collector **118** , to allow collector **118** to determine which capturing agent sent the report. Capturing agent identifiers in reports **244** can also be used to determine which capturing agents reported what flows. This information can then be used to determine capturing agent placement and topology, as further described below, as well as mapping individual flows to processes and users. Such additional insights gained can be useful for analyzing the data in reports **244** , as well as troubleshooting, security, visualization, configuration, planning, and management, and so forth.\nAs previously noted, the topology of the capturing agents can be ascertained from the reports **244**. To illustrate, a packet received by VM **110** A from fabric **112** can be captured and reported by VM capturing agent **202** A. Since the packet received by VM **110** A will also flow through leaf router **104** A and hypervisor **108** A, it can also be captured and reported by hypervisor capturing agent **206** A and network device capturing agent **226**. Thus, for a packet received by VM **110** A from fabric **112** , collector **118** can receive a report of the packet from VM capturing agent **202** A, hypervisor capturing agent **206** A, and network device capturing agent **226**.\nSimilarly, a packet sent by VM **110** A to fabric **112** can be captured and reported by VM capturing agent **202** A. Since the packet sent by VM **10** A will also flow through leaf router **104** A and hypervisor **108** A, it can also be captured and reported by hypervisor capturing agent **206** A and network device capturing agent **226**. Thus, for a packet sent by VM **10** A to fabric **112** , collector **118** can receive a report of the packet from VM capturing agent **202** A, hypervisor capturing agent **206** A, and network device capturing agent **226**.\nOn the other hand, a packet originating at, or destined to, hypervisor **108** A, can be captured and reported by hypervisor capturing agent **206** A and network device capturing agent **226** , but not VM capturing agent **202** A, as such packet may not flow through VM **110** A. Moreover, a packet originating at, or destined to, leaf router **104** A, will be captured and reported by network device capturing agent **226** , but not VM capturing agent **202** A, hypervisor capturing agent **206** A, or any other capturing agent on server **106** A, as such packet may not flow through VM **110** A, hypervisor **108** A, or server **106** A.\nInformation ascertained or inferred about the topology of the capturing agents can also be used with the reports **244** to detect problems. For example, the inferred topology of the capturing agents can be used with the current and/or historical statistics included in the reports **244** to infer or detect various conditions. To illustrate, traffic to and from fabric **112** captured by VM capturing agent **202** should also be captured by hypervisor capturing agent **206** and network device capturing agent **226**. Thus, if VM capturing agent **202** reports **200** packets to or from fabric **112** during a period of time and network device capturing agent **226** only reports **20** packets to or from fabric **112** during that same period of time, then one can infer from this discrepancy that VM capturing agent **202** has reported and/or captured an abnormal or unexpected number of packets during that period of time. This abnormal activity can be determined to indicate a faulty state of the VM capturing agent **202** , such as an error, a bug, malware, a virus, or a compromised condition.\nOther statistics and usage details determined from reports **244** can also be considered for determining problems or faults with capturing agents and/or hosts. For example, if hypervisor capturing agent **206** has typically reported in the past an average of **10** K server hits (e.g., Web, email, database, etc.) every 7 days, and reports **244** indicate a spike of **50** K server hits over the last 2 days, then one can infer that this abnormal levels of activity indicate a problem with the hypervisor capturing agent **206** and/or its host (i.e., hypervisor **108** or server **106**). The abnormal levels of activity can be a result of malware or a virus affecting the hypervisor capturing agent **206**.\nIn another example, if the reports **244** indicate that the VM capturing agent **202** has been generating unexpected, improper, or excessive traffic, such as sending packets or commands to a new or different device other than collector **118** âor other than any other system with which VM capturing agent **202** is expected or configured to communicate withâor sending the wrong types of packets (e.g., other than reports **244**) or sending traffic at unexpected times or events (e.g., without being triggered by a predefined setting or event such as the capturing of a packet processed by the host), then one can assume that VM capturing agent **202** has been compromised or is being manipulated by an unauthorized user or device.\nReports **244** can be transmitted to collector **118** periodically as new packets or traffic **242** are captured by a capturing agent, or otherwise based on a schedule, interval, or event, for example. Further, each capturing agent can send a single report or multiple reports to collector **118**. For example, each of the capturing agents can be configured to send a report to collector **118** for every flow, packet, message, communication, or network data received, transmitted, and/or generated by its respective host (e.g., VM **110** A, hypervisor **108** A, server **106** A, and leaf router **104** A). As such, collector **118** can receive a report of a same packet from multiple capturing agents. In other examples, one or more capturing agents can be configured to send a report to collector **118** for one or more flows, packets, messages, communications, network data, or subset(s) thereof, received, transmitted, and/or generated by the respective host during a period of time or interval.\nFIG. **3** illustrates a schematic diagram of an example configuration **300** for collecting capturing agent reports (i.e., control flows). In configuration **300** , traffic between fabric **112** and VM **110** A is configured to flow through hypervisor **108** A. Moreover, traffic between fabric **112** and hypervisor **108** A is configured to flow through leaf router **104** A.\nVM capturing agent **202** A can be configured to report to collector **118** traffic sent, received, or processed by VM **110** A. Hypervisor capturing agent **210** can be configured to report to collector **118** traffic sent, received, or processed by hypervisor **108** A. Finally, network device capturing agent **226** can be configured to report to collector **118** traffic sent, received, or processed by leaf router **104** A.\nCollector **118** can thus receive flows **302** from VM capturing agent **202** A, flows **304** from hypervisor capturing agent **206** A, and flows **406** from network device capturing agent **226**.  Flows **302** , **304** , and **306** can include control flows. Flows **302** can include flows captured by VM capturing agent **202** A at VM **110** A.\nFlows **304** can include flows captured by hypervisor capturing agent **206** A at hypervisor **108** A. Flows captured by hypervisor capturing agent **206** A can also include flows **302** captured by VM capturing agent **202** A, as traffic sent and received by VM **110** A will be received and observed by hypervisor **108** A and captured by hypervisor capturing agent **206** A.\nFlows **306** can include flows captured by network device capturing agent **226** at leaf router **104** A. Flows captured by network device capturing agent **226** can also include flows **302** captured by VM capturing agent **202** A and flows **304** captured by hypervisor capturing agent **206** A, as traffic sent and received by VM **110** A and hypervisor **108** A is routed through leaf router **104** A and can thus be captured by network device capturing agent **226**.\nCollector **118** can collect  flows **302** , **304** , and **306** , and store the reported data. Collector **118** can also forward some or all of  flows **302** , **304** , and **306** , and/or any respective portion thereof, to engine **120**. Engine **120** can process the information, including any information about the capturing agents (e.g., agent placement, agent environment, etc.) and/or the captured traffic (e.g., statistics), received from collector **118** to identify patterns, conditions, network or device characteristics; log statistics or history details; aggregate and/or process the data; generate reports, timelines, alerts, graphical user interfaces; detect errors, events, inconsistencies; troubleshoot networks or devices; configure networks or devices; deploy services or devices; reconfigure services, applications, devices, or networks; etc.\nCollector **118** and/or engine **120** can map individual flows that traverse VM **110** A, hypervisor **108** A, and/or leaf router **104** A to the specific capturing agents at VM **110** A, hypervisor **108** A, and/or leaf router **104** A. For example, collector **118** or engine **120** can determine that a particular flow that originated from VM **110** A and destined for fabric **112** was sent by VM **110** A and such flow was reported by VM capturing agent **202**. It may be determined that the same flow was received by a process named Z on hypervisor **108** A and forwarded to a process named W on leaf router **104** A and also reported by hypervisor capturing agent **206**.\nWhile engine **120** is illustrated as a separate entity, other configurations are also contemplated herein. For example, engine **120** can be part of collector **118** and/or a separate entity. Indeed, engine **120** can include one or more devices, applications, modules, databases, processing components, elements, etc. Moreover, collector **118** can represent one or more collectors. For example, in some configurations, collector **118** can include multiple collection systems or entities, which can reside in one or more networks.\nHaving disclosed some basic system components and concepts, the disclosure now turns to the exemplary method embodiment shown in FIG. **4** . For the sake of clarity, the method is described in terms of collector **118** and capturing agents **116** , as shown in FIG. **1** , configured to practice the various steps in the method. Furthermore, assume for the following discussion that host **106** C in FIG. **1** represents the computing device performing the steps of the claim to both receive network traffic and analysis a malware tracker, which for this example shall be host or server **106** D. Assume that network server under analysis is server/computing device **106** B. In this case, the goal is to evaluate whether device **106** B has malware or likely to get malware on it. The example methods can be practiced by any software or hardware components, devices, etc. heretofore disclosed. The steps outlined herein are exemplary and can be implemented in any combination thereof in any order, including combinations that exclude, add, or modify certain steps.\nThe current disclosure implements sensors or capturing agents within various hosts and layers in a network, such as VMs, hypervisors, servers, and hardware switches which capture data sent and received at each of these points and reports the data to a collector which can process, store, aggregate, manipulate, and/or analyze the data, and maintain the reported, sensed data. The collector can transmit the collected data from each sensor to the pipeline (e.g., particular engine), which can analyze any portion of the data and identify precise amounts of packet loss at each point. The pipeline can identify packet loss at each point by comparing data or packets captured and reported by capturing agents at each point. This comparison can be performed per flow, per link, per hop, per layer, per process and/or on a host basis. The information can affect a reputation score for a respective component in the network.\nMoreover, the pipeline can perform the comparison for data captured within a specific time window. For example, the pipeline can compare data from each point within a 30 minute time window. The pipeline can then identify packet loss at each point and determine if there is a problem at a specific point within the link, path, or flow. For example, the pipeline can analyze an aggregate of data captured for a 30 minute window of communications from S**1** to H**1** to S**2**. Based on the aggregated data, the pipeline can determine that S**1** reported 100% of the packets. H**1** reported 90% of the packets, and S**2** reported 80% of the packets. Here, the pipeline can thus determine that there is a 10% packet loss at each of H**1** and S**2**.\nThe concepts disclosed herein allow a centralized system to collect and aggregate data captured from sensors at each point within a communication path over a specific period of time and compare the information reported at each point to identify packet loss at each point. This mechanism can be implemented in a live environment and can accurately and efficiently ascertain packet loss at each point within a network.\nFIG. **4** illustrates a method aspect of this disclosure. An exemplary method can be performed by a system or any computing device whether physical or virtual. The method includes receiving network traffic (at server **106** C) from a host (Server **106** A) having a host IP address and operating in a data center (**402**), and analyzing a malware tracker for IP addresses of hosts having been infected by a malware (server **106** D) to yield an analysis (**404**). Data associated with the network traffic can be received from at least a first capture agent at a device hardware layer of the data center, a second capture agent at a hypervisor layer of the data center, and a third capture agent at a virtual machine layer of the data center. When the analysis indicates that the host IP address has been used to communicate with an external host infected by the malware to yield an indication, the method includes assigning a reputation score, based on the indication, to the host (**406**). The method can further include applying a conditional policy associated with using the host based on the reputation score. The reputation score can include a reduced reputation score from a previous reputation score for the host. Reputation scores can go up or down based on continued negative activity or a period of positive activity. The host in this case can also be at any layer of the data center, such as the virtual layer, the hypervisor layer or the physical layer.\nThe method can include analyzing an effectiveness of a policy related to communications with the host based on the reputation score. For example, if a low reputation score is supposed to prevent certain packet flows to the server, then the system can capture that data associated with the packet flows for analysis and determine whether to proceed and how to proceed. The method can also include separating malicious and non-malicious behavior based on the indication. Analyzing the malware tracker can mean crawling multiple malware trackers. In this case, assume that server **106** D represents two or more servers, each server acting as a malware tracker. Finally, assigning the reputation score is further based on data associated with the host and received from a whois (or similar) database. The whois database is a query and response protocol that is used for querying databases that store the registered users or assignees of an internet resource such as a domain name, an IP address block, or an autonomous system. It can be used for other information as well.\nReputation scores can relate to vulnerability indexes, security strength, a trust level for different types of communication with a device, and so forth. They can be derived from one or more of an external source or sources, such as malware trackers or whois, or travel data which is easy to obtain, and/or data obtained from the various layers of a network including a physical layer, a hypervisor layer and a virtual layer. Reputation scores can be identified and tracked using the various layers of capture agents disclosed herein. In other words, the selection of reputation scores and tracking of reputations for devices can be based, at least in part, on capture agents configured in a device hardware layer **104** A, a hypervisor layer **108** A, and/or a virtual machine layer **110**. The data obtained from these capture agents can also be coordinated with external data or other data to arrive at a reputation score. The reputation scores can also be applied to applications and can govern what level of access they may have to particular devices/entities in a network.\nWith the information at the various levels, increased fine tuning can occur within provisioning and managing of new entities or existing entities. More advanced reputation score management can occur. For example, if there is a hypervisor that has a high reputation, assume that the system is about to deploy a virtual machine that might have a lower reputation. In this case, the system might determine that deploying such a virtual machine might negatively affect the desired reputation of the hypervisor and therefore select a different host for the virtual machine or might implement the virtual machine with policies to prevent it from achieving a low reputation score. Thus, the high reputation of the hypervisor can be maintained for virtual devices that are provisioned within the hypervisor. Thus, reputations for one layer of the network can be managed through control of provisioning or management of entities in a different layer. The approach can apply to higher layers or lower layers to the layer in which an entity is being provisioned.\nThe hypervisors will each have a virtual switch and each virtual machine can also have a virtual network interface. With the disclosure, one can analyze the behavior of these virtual switches and/or virtual network interfaces and use that data in establishing reputation scores for assignment or association with the policies.\nFIG. **5** illustrates a listing **500** of example fields on a capturing agent report. The listing **500** can include one or more fields, such as:\nFlow identifier (e.g., unique identifier associated with the flow).\nCapturing agent identifier (e.g., data uniquely identifying reporting capturing agent).\nTimestamp (e.g., time of event, report, etc.).\nInterval (e.g., time between current report and previous report, interval between flows or packets, interval between events, etc.).\nDuration (e.g., duration of event, duration of communication, duration of flow, duration of report, etc.).\nFlow direction (e.g., egress flow, ingress flow, etc.).\nApplication identifier (e.g., identifier of application associated with flow, process, event, or data).\nPort (e.g., source port, destination port, layer 4 port, etc.).\nDestination address (e.g., interface address associated with destination, IP address, domain name, network address, hardware address, virtual address, physical address, etc.).\nSource address (e.g., interface address associated with source, IP address, domain name, network address, hardware address, virtual address, physical address, etc.).\nInterface (e.g., interface address, interface information, etc.).\nProtocol (e.g., layer 4 protocol, layer 3 protocol, etc.).\nEvent (e.g., description of event, event identifier, etc.).\nFlag (e.g., layer 3 flag, flag options, etc.).\nTag (e.g., virtual local area network tag, etc.).\nProcess (e.g., process identifier, etc.).\nUser (e.g., OS username, etc.).\nBytes (e.g., flow size, packet size, transmission size, etc.).\nSensor Type (e.g., the type of virtualized environment hosting the capturing agent, such as hypervisor or VM; the type of virtual network device, such as VNIC, LINUX bridge, OVS, software switch, etc.).\nThe listing **500** includes a non-limiting example of fields in a report. Other fields and data items are also contemplated herein, such as handshake information, system information, network address associated with capturing agent or host, operating system environment information, network data or statistics, process statistics, system statistics, etc. The order in which these fields are illustrated is also exemplary and can be rearranged in any other way.

Each of the fields can include data, metadata, and/or any other information relevant to the fields.\nThe disclosure now turns to the example network device and system illustrated in FIGS. **6** and **7** A-B.\nFIG. **6** illustrates an example network device **610** according to some embodiments.
